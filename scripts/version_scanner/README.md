# Automated Dependency Version Scanner

This tool scans the repository for hardcoded references to specific dependency versions (like Python 3.7) that need to be upgraded or removed.

## Usage

Run the script from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/version_scanner/version_scanner.py -d <dependency> -v <version> [options]
```

### Options

*   `-d`, `--dependency`: Name of the dependency (e.g., python, protobuf)
*   `-v`, `--version`: Specific version to search for (e.g., 3.7, 4.25.8)
*   `-p`, `--path`: Root directory to scan (defaults to current directory)
*   `--package`: Specific subdirectory filter (useful for monorepos)
*   `--package-file`: Path to a file containing a list of package directories to scan (e.g., `scripts/version_scanner/small_package_list.txt`)
*   `--config`: Path to the regex configuration file (defaults to scripts/version_scanner/regex_config.yaml)
*   `-o`, `--output`: Path to the output CSV file (defaults to <dependency>-<version>-<timestamp>.csv)
*   `--github-repo`: GitHub repository URL base (defaults to https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python)
*   `--branch`: GitHub branch for links (defaults to main)

## Installation & Setup

By default, the core scanner only depends on Python's standard library and **`pyyaml`** to read the configuration file.

If you want to use the Google Drive upload feature (`--upload`), you must install the optional Google API client dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r scripts/version_scanner/requirements.txt
```

## Scope: Handwritten vs. Generated Code

> [!NOTE]
> **This scanner is primarily intended for auditing handwritten code, configuration files, CI scripts, and documentation.**
> You do **not** need to scan or manually edit auto-generated GAPIC libraries. Any dependency updates for generated code are handled upstream by editing the generator templates in the `gapic-generator-python` repository. When the templates are updated, the changes naturally trickle downstream to correct all generated client libraries upon the next regeneration.

## Limitations

*   **Single-Line Matching Only**: The scanner processes files line-by-line to ensure high performance and simplicity. Consequently, version declarations or dependency lists that span across multiple lines (such as multiline lists in a `setup.py` file) will not be caught by the regex patterns.

## Configuration

The scanner uses a YAML configuration file (`regex_config.yaml`) to define rules and regex patterns.

## Ignoring Directories

You can create a `.scannerignore` file in the directory you are scanning (usually the repo root) to list directories to skip, one per line.

## Known Issues & Future Investigations
- **Binary Ignores in `.scannerignore`**: Recursive wildcard ignores (e.g., `*.jpg`) currently do not effectively ignore deeply nested binary files. The scanner logic should be investigated to support robust globbing or full-path suffix matching.

## Universal Prompt for EOL Runtime & Dependency Migration

### Context & Overview

#### Overview
This plan outlines the approach to update Python packages to drop support for end-of-life Python runtimes (3.7, 3.8, 3.9) OR for deprecated dependencies, and ensure the packages are configured for modern Python.

#### High-Level Strategy
- **One Branch Per Package**: To keep PRs manageable and isolated, we suggest a dedicated worktree and branch for each package (e.g., `feat/drop-<dependency>-<version>-<package-name>` i.e. `feat/drop-protobuf-4.25.8-google-cloud-bigquery`).
- **Small & Reversible Commits**: Group changes into logical commits (Metadata, Nox, Docs, Cleanup, Tests) following Conventional Commits.

### Per-Package Workflow

Follow these steps for each package in the target list. Context and warnings are provided inline before the steps where they apply.

#### Step 1: Sync & Branch
1. Ensure `main` branch is up to date.
2. Create the feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/drop-<dependency>-<version>-<package-name>`.

#### Step 2: Scan (Baseline)
1. Run the `version_scanner` for the package to get a list of all occurrences of the dependency and version.
   > [!TIP]
   > Use `# version-scanner: ignore` or `ignore-next-line` in code to silence true false-positives and maintain clean reports.

---

#### 💡 Context for Step 3: Standards & Cleanup
*Before applying changes, review these standards to ensure consistency:*

##### Runtime Version Checks
- **Standard**: Use `sys.version_info < (X, Y)`.
- **Rationale**: Python compares tuples lexicographically, making this robust.
- **Avoid**: `sys.version_info.minor < Y` or string conversions.

##### Pytest Skips
- **Standard**: `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (X, Y), reason="Requires Python X.Y+")`.
- **Avoid**: String-based conditions like `@pytest.mark.skipif("sys.version_info < ...")`.

##### Noxfile Version Matches
- **Standard**: `session.python == "X.Y"` (Nox uses strings).
- **Avoid**: `float(session.python) < X.Y` (fails for `3.10`).

##### Cleanup Rules
- **Polyfills**: Remove dead `try/except` blocks guarding polyfills for features now standard in 3.10+.
- **Obsolete Skips**: Remove pytest skips for features now universally available.

##### Dependency Specific rules
- Use idiomatic python references to detect dependency versions and to compare against the target version.

---

#### 💡 Context for Step 3: Disposition Rules
*Every reference to the dependency version found by the scanner must be dispositioned in one of these ways:*

1. **Update**: Update the reference if still necessary (e.g., changing `3.9` to `3.10` in support files).
2. **Delete**: Delete if no longer relevant (dead code, obsolete comments).
3. **Pragma Ignore**: Use `# version-scanner: ignore` or `# version-scanner: ignore-next-line` but ONLY for immutable historical facts or true false positives. Do NOT use for things that might change in future upgrades.

#### Step 3: Apply Changes
1. Update `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` metadata and `requires-python`.
2. Update `noxfile.py` to remove old versions from sessions.
3. Update `README.rst` and `CONTRIBUTING.rst` documentation.
4. Remove compatibility code and skips based on the standards above.
5. **Sync Documentation**: If the package has a `docs` folder containing a `README.rst`, copy the updated top-level `README.rst` to overwrite it (unless it is a symlink).
6. Continue with the update process until all rows from the scan have been properly dispositioned.

---

#### Step 4: Verify (Post-Scan)
1. Run the `version_scanner` again. The result should be 0 matches (or only valid ignores).

---

#### 💡 Context for Step 5: Constraints & Conflicts
*Review these lessons learned when dealing with constraints:*

- **Lowest Runtime Constraints**: The file for the lowest accepted runtime (e.g., `constraints-3.10.txt`) must have pins matching the lowest acceptable versions in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`.
- **Philosophy on Warnings**: Do not simply block warnings (like `six` or `pkg_resources`) to make tests pass. **Bump the lower bounds** of dependencies to versions that don't trigger warnings on the current lowest acceptable runtime. This protects customers who use strict warning filters.
- **SQLAlchemy Transition**: For libraries supporting both 1.4 and 2.0, use `SQLALCHEMY_SILENCE_UBER_WARNING=1` in specific legacy Nox sessions rather than silencing globally.

---

#### Step 5: Local Test
1. Run unit tests using Nox (e.g., `nox -s unit`).
   > [!TIP]
   > Use `nox -s unit-3.10` to save time when debugging specific runtime failures.
2. Run `blacken` and `lint` sessions.

#### Step 6: Push & PR
1. Push the branch and create the PR using the template in the Appendix.

## Candidates for `.conductor` or `gemini.md`

*The following guidelines are universal for AI assistants workin' in this repo and should be moved to `.conductor` files or Gemini memories:*

1. **AI & LLM Guidelines for Verification**:
   - Use Git Worktrees to scan branches without switching.
   - Run scanner from main branch pointing to worktree.
   - Bypass env artifacts by worktree only checking out tracked files.
2. **Automated Bisection**:
   - Use `version_bisector.py` to find lowest workable versions.
   - Abort tests early as soon as collection succeeds to save time.
