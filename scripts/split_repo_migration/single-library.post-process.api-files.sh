# This script was written as part of a project to migrate
# split repositories to the mono-repository google-cloud-python.
#
# This script will update the various metadata files migrated from the split
# repo into formats and locations suitable for the mono-repo. This script deals
# with API-specific file, and can be invoked on many just-migrated APIs in any
# order. There is a companion scripts. *.common-files.sh, which must be invoked
# for all APIs to finish the migration to common, but which cannot be
# parallelized, as it touches shared files.
#
# Pre-condition: the split repo has been copied to the path indicated when
# calling this function.
#
# INVOCATION from the mono-repo root directory:
#   single-library.post-process.api-files.sh PACKAGE_PATH
# where PACKAGE_PATH is the path (absolute or relative) from pwd to the
# directory in google-cloud-python holding the copied split repo. Typically, if
# running from the top level of google-cloud-python, this is something like
# "packages/google-cloud-APINAME"
# EXAMPLE from the root directory of the monorepo:
#   ./scripts/split_repo_migration/single-library.post-process.api-files.sh packages/google-cloud-speech
#
# For debugging/developing this script, you can have additional parameters:
#  ./single-library.post-process.api-files.sh SPLIT_REPO_DIR MONOREPO_DIR MONOREPO_PACKAGE_NAME 
# Example from this script's directory:
#  ./single-library.post-process.api-files.sh ../../../python-speech ../../ google-cloud-speech
