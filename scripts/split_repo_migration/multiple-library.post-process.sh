# This script was written as part of a project to migrate
# split repositories to the mono-repository google-cloud-python.
#
# This script takes a list of packages. It will first call
# single-library.post-process.common-files.sh on each package to update the
# various metadata files migrated from the split repo. It will then cause the
# OwlBot post-processor to run once (via Docker) for all the repos together to
# update the appropriate files.
#
# This script deals with common (shared) files, and thus CANNOT be called in
# parallel for individual APIs, since each run touches shared files and would
# thus lead to merge conflicts.
#
# Pre-condition: the split repo has been copied to the path indicated when
# calling this function.
#
# INVOCATION 
#   multiple-library.post-process.common-files.sh DIR PACKAGE [PACKAGE...]
# where dir is the path to the monorepo (relative dirs, like "." are fine) and
# PACKAGE is the name of a (newly migrated) package in the monorepo.
# EXAMPLE from the root directory of the monorepo:
#   ./scripts/split_repo_migration/multiple-library.post-process.common-files.sh . google-cloud-speech
#
