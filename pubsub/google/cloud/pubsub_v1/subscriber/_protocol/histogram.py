    """Representation of a single histogram.

    The purpose of this class is to store actual ack timing information
    in order to predict how long to renew leases.

    The default implementation uses the 99th percentile of previous ack
    times to implicitly lease messages; however, custom
    :class:`~.pubsub_v1.subscriber._consumer.Consumer` subclasses
    are free to use a different formula.

    The precision of data stored is to the nearest integer. Additionally,
    values outside the range of ``10 <= x <= 600`` are stored as ``10`` or
    ``600``, since these are the boundaries of leases in the actual API.
