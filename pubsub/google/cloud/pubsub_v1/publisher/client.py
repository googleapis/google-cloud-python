    """A publisher client for Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

    This creates an object that is capable of publishing messages.
    Generally, you can instantiate this client with no arguments, and you
    get sensible defaults.

    Args:
        publisher_options (~google.cloud.pubsub_v1.types.PublisherOptions): The
            options for the publisher client. Note that enabling message ordering will
            override the publish retry timeout to be infinite.
        batch_settings (~google.cloud.pubsub_v1.types.BatchSettings): The
            settings for batch publishing.
        kwargs (dict): Any additional arguments provided are sent as keyword
            arguments to the underlying
            :class:`~google.cloud.pubsub_v1.gapic.publisher_client.PublisherClient`.
            Generally you should not need to set additional keyword
            arguments. Optionally, publish retry settings can be set via
            ``client_config`` where user-provided retry configurations are
            applied to default retry settings. And regional endpoints can be
            set via ``client_options`` that takes a single key-value pair that
            defines the endpoint.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

            (``bytes`` in Python 3; ``str`` in Python 2), and this library

            The reason that this is so important (and why we do not try to
            coerce for you) is because Pub/Sub is also platform independent
            and there is no way to know how to decode messages properly on
            the other side; therefore, encoding and decoding is a required
            exercise for the developer.

            ordering_key: A string that identifies related messages for which
                publish order should be respected. Message ordering must be
                enabled for this client to use this feature.
