Welcome to pandas-gbq's documentation!
======================================

The :mod:`pandas_gbq` module provides a wrapper for Google's BigQuery
analytics web service to simplify retrieving results from BigQuery tables
using SQL-like queries. Result sets are parsed into a pandas
DataFrame with a shape and data types derived from the source table.
Additionally, DataFrames can be inserted into new BigQuery tables or appended
to existing tables.

.. warning::

   To use this module, you will need a valid BigQuery account. Refer to the
   `BigQuery Documentation <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery>`__
   for details on the service itself.
