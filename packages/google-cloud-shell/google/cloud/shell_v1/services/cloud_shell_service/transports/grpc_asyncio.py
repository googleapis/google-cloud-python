class CloudShellServiceGrpcAsyncIOTransport(CloudShellServiceTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for CloudShellService.

    API for interacting with Google Cloud Shell. Each user of
    Cloud Shell has at least one environment, which has the ID
    "default". Environment consists of a Docker image defining what
    is installed on the environment and a home directory containing
    the user's data that will remain across sessions. Clients use
    this API to start and fetch information about their environment,
    which can then be used to connect to that environment via a
    separate SSH client.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
