            this environment belongs, and ``{environment_id}`` is the

            Output only. Username that clients should use
            when initiating SSH sessions with the
            environment.
        ssh_host (str):

            Output only. Public keys associated with the
            environment. Clients can connect to this
            environment via SSH only if they possess a
            private key corresponding to at least one of
