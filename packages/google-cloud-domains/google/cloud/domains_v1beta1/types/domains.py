    There are several ways to create a new ``Registration`` resource:

    To create a new ``Registration`` resource, find a suitable domain
    name by calling the ``SearchDomains`` method with a query to see
    available domain name options. After choosing a name, call
    ``RetrieveRegisterParameters`` to ensure availability and obtain
    information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to
    ``RegisterDomain``.

    Another way to create a new ``Registration`` is to transfer an
    existing domain from another registrar. First, go to the current
    registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the
    domain's transfer authorization code. Then call
    ``RetrieveTransferParameters`` to confirm that the domain is
    unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to
    ``TransferDomain``.

    Attributes:

            Output only. Name of the ``Registration`` resource, in the

            Required. Immutable. The domain name. Unicode
            domain names must be expressed in Punycode

            that change its ``registrant_contact`` or ``privacy`` fields

            Required. The project and location from which to list
            ``Registration``\ s, specified in the format
            ``projects/*/locations/*``.
        page_size (int):
            Maximum number of results to return.
        page_token (str):
            When set to the ``next_page_token`` from a prior response,
            provides the next page of results.
        filter (str):
            Filter expression to restrict the ``Registration``\ s
            returned.

            The expression must specify the field name, a comparison
            operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering.
            The value must be a string, a number, a boolean, or an enum
            value. The comparison operator should be one of =, !=, >, <,
            >=, <=, or : for prefix or wildcard matches.

            For example, to filter to a specific domain name, use an
            expression like ``domainName="example.com"``. You can also
            check for the existence of a field; for example, to find
            domains using custom DNS settings, use an expression like
            ``dnsSettings.customDns:*``.

            You can also create compound filters by combining
            expressions with the ``AND`` and ``OR`` operators. For
            example, to find domains that are suspended or have specific
            issues flagged, use an expression like
            ``(state=SUSPENDED) OR (issue:*)``.
