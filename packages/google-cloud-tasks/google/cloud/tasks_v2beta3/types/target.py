            The default value is set to ``"application/json"``.

    The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the

    be removed from the queue. If any other HTTP response code is

    -  User-specified throttling: [retry
       configuration][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.retry_config],
       [rate limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.rate_limits], and
       the [queue's state][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.state].

    -  System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud
       Tasks may temporarily reduce the queue's effective rate.
       User-specified settings will not be changed.

    System throttling happens because:

    -  Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff
       specified in [rate
       limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.rate_limits] will be
       used. But if the worker returns ``429`` (Too Many Requests),
       ``503`` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of errors is high,
       Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry specified
       in the ``Retry-After`` HTTP response header is considered.

    -  To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden increases in
       traffic, dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly
       created or idle and if large numbers of tasks suddenly become
       available to dispatch (due to spikes in create task rates, the
       queue being unpaused, or many tasks that are scheduled at the

    The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine
    app when the task is dispatched.

    Using
    [AppEngineHttpRequest][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest]
    requires
    ```appengine.applications.get`` <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control>`__
    Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope:

    ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform``

    The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to
    the same project as the queue. For more information, see `How
    Requests are
    Routed <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed>`__
    and how routing is affected by `dispatch
    files <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref>`__.
    Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google
    datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication
    mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol
    (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however,
    will appear to have used the HTTP protocol.

    The [AppEngineRouting][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineRouting]
    used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set
    at the queue-level or task-level:

    -  If set,
       [app_engine_routing_override][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpQueue.app_engine_routing_override]
       is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is
       for the [task-level
       app_engine_routing][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest.app_engine_routing].

    The ``url`` that the task will be sent to is:

    -  ``url =``
       [host][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineRouting.host] ``+``
       [relative_uri][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest.relative_uri]

    Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app
    handlers, and URIs restricted with
    ```login: admin`` <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref>`__.
    Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to
    URIs restricted with
    ```login: required`` <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref>`__
    Task dispatches also do not follow redirects.

    The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns
    an HTTP response code in the range [``200`` - ``299``]. The task
    attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response
    code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the
    [deadline][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Task.dispatch_deadline].
    Failed tasks will be retried according to the [retry
    configuration][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.retry_config].
    ``503`` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system
    error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks'
    traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's
    dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a ``429`` (Too Many
    Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic
    congestion control to throttle the queue.

    Attributes:
        http_method (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.HttpMethod):
            The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST.

            The app's request handler for the task's target URL must be
            able to handle HTTP requests with this http_method,
            otherwise the task attempt fails with error code 405 (Method
            Not Allowed). See `Writing a push task request
            handler <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#writing_a_push_task_request_handler>`__

        app_engine_routing (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.AppEngineRouting):

            [app_engine_routing_override][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpQueue.app_engine_routing_override]

            app_engine_routing][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest.app_engine_routing].
        relative_uri (str):
            The relative URI.

            The relative URI must begin with "/" and must be
            a valid HTTP relative URI. It can contain a path
            and query string arguments. If the relative URI
            is empty, then the root path "/" will be used.
            No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length
            allowed is 2083 characters.
        headers (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            HTTP request headers.

            This map contains the header field names and values. Headers
            can be set when the [task is
            created][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateTask].
            Repeated headers are not supported but a header value can
            contain commas.

            Cloud Tasks sets some headers to default values:

            -  ``User-Agent``: By default, this header is
               ``"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"``.
               This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append
               ``"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"``
               to the modified ``User-Agent``.

            If the task has a
            [body][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest.body],
            Cloud Tasks sets the following headers:

            -  ``Content-Type``: By default, the ``Content-Type`` header
               is set to ``"application/octet-stream"``. The default can
               be overridden by explicitly setting ``Content-Type`` to a
               particular media type when the [task is
               created][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateTask].
               For example, ``Content-Type`` can be set to
               ``"application/json"``.
            -  ``Content-Length``: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This
               value is output only. It cannot be changed.

            The headers below cannot be set or overridden:

            -  ``Host``
            -  ``X-Google-*``
            -  ``X-AppEngine-*``

            In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is
            dispatched, such as headers containing information about the
            task; see `request
            headers <https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#reading_request_headers>`__.
            These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so
            they are not visible when the task is returned in a Cloud
            Tasks response.

            Although there is no specific limit for the maximum number
            of headers or the size, there is a limit on the maximum size
            of the [Task][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Task]. For more
            information, see the
            [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateTask]
