    Configurable properties include rate limits, retry options,
    queue types, and others.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Caller-specified and required in
            [CreateQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateQueue],
            after which it becomes output only.

            The queue name.

            The queue name must have the following format:
            ``projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID``

            -  ``PROJECT_ID`` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers
               ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For
               more information, see `Identifying
               projects <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects>`__
            -  ``LOCATION_ID`` is the canonical ID for the queue's
               location. The list of available locations can be obtained
               by calling
               [ListLocations][google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations].
               For more information, see
               https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.
            -  ``QUEUE_ID`` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers
               ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100
               characters.
        app_engine_http_queue (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.AppEngineHttpQueue):
            [AppEngineHttpQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpQueue]
            settings apply only to [App Engine
            tasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest] in
            this queue. [Http
            tasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.HttpRequest] are not
            affected by this proto.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``queue_type``.
        http_target (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.HttpTarget):
            Modifies HTTP target for HTTP tasks.
        rate_limits (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.RateLimits):
            Rate limits for task dispatches.

            [rate_limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.rate_limits]
            and
            [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.retry_config]
            are related because they both control task attempts. However
            they control task attempts in different ways:

            -  [rate_limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.rate_limits]
               controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e.
               all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of
               whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry).
            -  [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.retry_config]
               controls what happens to particular a task after its
               first attempt fails. That is,
               [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.retry_config]
               controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt,
               etc).

            The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:

            -  Number of tasks in the queue
            -  User-specified throttling:
               [rate_limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.rate_limits],
               [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.retry_config],
               and the [queue's
               state][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Queue.state].
            -  System throttling due to ``429`` (Too Many Requests) or
               ``503`` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker,
               high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic
               spikes.
        retry_config (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.RetryConfig):
            Settings that determine the retry behavior.

            -  For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level
               retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were
               created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set
               on individual tasks.
            -  For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the
               queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the
               queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on
               the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See `App
               Engine
               documentation <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks>`__.
        state (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.Queue.State):
            Output only. The state of the queue.

            ``state`` can only be changed by called
            [PauseQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.PauseQueue],
            [ResumeQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.ResumeQueue],
            or uploading
            `queue.yaml/xml <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref>`__.
            [UpdateQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.UpdateQueue]
            cannot be used to change ``state``.
        purge_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last time this queue was purged.

            All tasks that were
            [created][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Task.create_time]
            before this time were purged.

            A queue can be purged using
            [PurgeQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.PurgeQueue],
            the `App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud
            Console <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue>`__.

            Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond.
            Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
        task_ttl (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in
            this queue.

            Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default ``task_ttl`` of
            31 days. After a task has lived for ``task_ttl``, the task
            will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or
            not.

            The ``task_ttl`` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is
            equal to the maximum duration because there is a `storage
            quota <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue>`__
            for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see
            the documentation for [Duration][google.protobuf.Duration].
        tombstone_ttl (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The task tombstone time to live (TTL).

            After a task is deleted or executed, the task's tombstone is
            retained for the length of time specified by
            ``tombstone_ttl``. The tombstone is used by task
            de-duplication; another task with the same name can't be
            created until the tombstone has expired. For more
            information about task de-duplication, see the documentation
            for
            [CreateTaskRequest][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CreateTaskRequest.task].

            Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default
            ``tombstone_ttl`` of 1 hour.
        stackdriver_logging_config (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.StackdriverLoggingConfig):
            Configuration options for writing logs to `Stackdriver
            Logging <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/>`__. If this
            field is unset, then no logs are written.
        type_ (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.Queue.Type):
            Immutable. The type of a queue (push or pull).

            ``Queue.type`` is an immutable property of the queue that is
            set at the queue creation time. When left unspecified, the
            default value of ``PUSH`` is selected.
        stats (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3.types.QueueStats):
            Output only. The realtime, informational
            statistics for a queue. In order to receive the
            statistics the caller should include this field
            in the FieldMask.

                If the queue was created using Cloud Tasks and the queue has
                had no activity (method calls or task dispatches) for 30
                days, the queue may take a few minutes to re-activate. Some
                method calls may return
                [NOT_FOUND][google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND] and tasks may not be
                dispatched for a few minutes until the queue has been
                re-activated.
            PAUSED (2):
                Tasks are paused by the user. If the queue is
                paused then Cloud Tasks will stop delivering
                tasks from it, but more tasks can still be added
                to it by the user.
            DISABLED (3):
                The queue is disabled.

                A queue becomes ``DISABLED`` when
                `queue.yaml <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref>`__
                or

                directly disable a queue.

                When a queue is disabled, tasks can still be added to a
                queue but the tasks are not dispatched.

class RateLimits(proto.Message):

    This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be

    task attempt or a retry.

    Note: The debugging command,
    [RunTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.RunTask], will run a
    task even if the queue has reached its
    [RateLimits][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RateLimits].

    Attributes:
        max_dispatches_per_second (float):
            The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this
            queue.

            If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will
            pick the default.

            -  For [App Engine
               queues][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpQueue],
               the maximum allowed value is 500.

            queue.yaml/xml <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#rate>`__.
        max_burst_size (int):
            The max burst size.

            Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed
            when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This
            field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing
            starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
            resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short
            period of time.

            The `token
            bucket <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket>`__
            algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches.
            Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the
            maximum specified by ``max_burst_size``. Each time a task is
            dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will
            be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens.
            The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens
            based on
            [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].

            The default value of ``max_burst_size`` is picked by Cloud
            Tasks based on the value of
            [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].

            The maximum value of ``max_burst_size`` is 500.

            For App Engine queues that were created or updated using
            ``queue.yaml/xml``, ``max_burst_size`` is equal to
            `bucket_size <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size>`__.
            If
            [UpdateQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.UpdateQueue]
            is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for
            ``max_burst_size``, ``max_burst_size`` value will get

            [UpdateQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.UpdateQueue]

            [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].
        max_concurrent_dispatches (int):
            The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks
            allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold
            has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until
            the number of concurrent requests decreases.

            If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will

        max_backoff (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            A task will be

            for retry between

        max_doublings (int):
            The time between retries will double ``max_doublings``
            times.

            A task's retry interval starts at
            [min_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.min_backoff],
            then doubles ``max_doublings`` times, then increases
            linearly, and finally retries at intervals of
            [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.max_backoff]
            up to
            [max_attempts][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.max_attempts]
            times.

            For example, if
            [min_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.min_backoff]
            is 10s,
            [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.max_backoff]
            is 300s, and ``max_doublings`` is 3, then the a task will
            first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double
            three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 \* 10s.
            Finally, the task will retry at intervals of
            [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.max_backoff]
            until the task has been attempted
            [max_attempts][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.RetryConfig.max_attempts]
            times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s,
            160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, ....

            If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will
            pick the default.
