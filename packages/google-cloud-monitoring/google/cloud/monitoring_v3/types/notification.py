        type_ (str):

            description for how that field should be

        supported_tiers (MutableSequence[google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.ServiceTier]):
            The tiers that support this notification channel; the
            project service tier must be one of the supported_tiers.
        launch_stage (google.api.launch_stage_pb2.LaunchStage):

class NotificationChannel(proto.Message):
    r"""A ``NotificationChannel`` is a medium through which an alert is
    delivered when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels
    include email, SMS, and third-party messaging applications. Fields
    containing sensitive information like authentication tokens or
    contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

    Attributes:
        type_ (str):
            The type of the notification channel. This field matches the
            value of the
            [NotificationChannelDescriptor.type][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelDescriptor.type]
            field.
        name (str):
            The full REST resource name for this channel. The format is:

            ::

                projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]

            The ``[CHANNEL_ID]`` is automatically assigned by the server
            on creation.
        display_name (str):
            An optional human-readable name for this
            notification channel. It is recommended that you
            specify a non-empty and unique name in order to
            make it easier to identify the channels in your
            project, though this is not enforced. The
            display name is limited to 512 Unicode
            characters.
        description (str):
            An optional human-readable description of
            this notification channel. This description may
            provide additional details, beyond the display
            name, for the channel. This may not exceed 1024
            Unicode characters.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Configuration fields that define the channel and its
            behavior. The permissible and required labels are specified
            in the
            [NotificationChannelDescriptor.labels][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelDescriptor.labels]
            of the ``NotificationChannelDescriptor`` corresponding to
            the ``type`` field.
        user_labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform
            to the corresponding ``NotificationChannelDescriptor``'s
            schema, unlike the ``labels`` field. This field is intended
            to be used for organizing and identifying the
            ``NotificationChannel`` objects.

            The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value
            is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever
            is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase
            letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin
            with a letter.
        verification_status (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.NotificationChannel.VerificationStatus):
            Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On
            a
            [``ListNotificationChannels``][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.ListNotificationChannels]
            or
            [``GetNotificationChannel``][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.GetNotificationChannel]
            operation, this field is expected to be populated.

            If the value is ``UNVERIFIED``, then it indicates that the
            channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification
            and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the
            channel works.

            If the channel is neither ``VERIFIED`` nor ``UNVERIFIED``,
            it implies that the channel is of a type that does not
            require verification or that this specific channel has been
            exempted from verification because it was created prior to
            verification being required for channels of this type.

            This field cannot be modified using a standard
            [``UpdateNotificationChannel``][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.UpdateNotificationChannel]
            operation. To change the value of this field, you must call
            [``VerifyNotificationChannel``][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.VerifyNotificationChannel].
        enabled (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Whether notifications are forwarded to the
            described channel. This makes it possible to
            disable delivery of notifications to a
            particular channel without removing the channel
            from all alerting policies that reference the
            channel. This is a more convenient approach when
            the change is temporary and you want to receive
            notifications from the same set of alerting
            policies on the channel at some point in the
            future.
        creation_record (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.MutationRecord):
            Record of the creation of this channel.
        mutation_records (MutableSequence[google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.MutationRecord]):
            Records of the modification of this channel.

                (as in the case of channels that neither support
                nor require verification in order to function).

                requires verification to function. Note that

                sending a verification code but where the
                verification code has not been submitted to
                complete the process.
            VERIFIED (2):

                received on this notification channel and that
                someone on the project has access to messages
