               former policy in your notifications and incidents.
            -  Conditions in the new policy will keep their former
               ``[CONDITION_ID]`` if the supplied condition includes the
               ``name`` field with that ``[CONDITION_ID]``. If the
               supplied condition omits the ``name`` field, then a new
               ``[CONDITION_ID]`` is created.
