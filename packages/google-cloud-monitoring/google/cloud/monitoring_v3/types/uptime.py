        region (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.UptimeCheckRegion):
            A broad region category in which the IP
            address is located.
        location (str):
            A more specific location within the region
            that typically encodes a particular
            city/town/metro (and its containing
            state/province or country) within the broader
            umbrella region category.
        ip_address (str):
            The IP address from which the Uptime check
            originates. This is a fully specified IP address
            (not an IP address range). Most IP addresses, as
            of this publication, are in IPv4 format;
            however, one should not rely on the IP addresses
            being in IPv4 format indefinitely, and should
            support interpreting this field in either IPv4
            or IPv6 format.
