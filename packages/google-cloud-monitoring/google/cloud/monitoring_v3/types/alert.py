class AlertPolicy(proto.Message):
    r"""A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your
    system is considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify people
    or services about this state. For an overview of alerting policies,
    see `Introduction to
    Alerting <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/>`__.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. Required if the policy exists. The resource name
            for this policy. The format is:

            ::

                projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID]

            ``[ALERT_POLICY_ID]`` is assigned by Cloud Monitoring when
            the policy is created. When calling the
            [alertPolicies.create][google.monitoring.v3.AlertPolicyService.CreateAlertPolicy]
            method, do not include the ``name`` field in the alerting
            policy passed as part of the request.
        display_name (str):
            A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in
            dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid
            confusion, don't use the same display name for multiple
            policies in the same project. The name is limited to 512
            Unicode characters.

            The convention for the display_name of a
            PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition is "{rule group
            name}/{alert name}", where the {rule group name} and {alert
            name} should be taken from the corresponding Prometheus
            configuration file. This convention is not enforced. In any
            case the display_name is not a unique key of the
            AlertPolicy.
        documentation (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Documentation):
            Documentation that is included with
            notifications and incidents related to this
            policy. Best practice is for the documentation
            to include information to help responders
            understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the
            underlying problems detected by the alerting
            policy. Notification channels that have limited
            capacity might not show this documentation.
        user_labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            User-supplied key/value data to be used for organizing and
            identifying the ``AlertPolicy`` objects.

            The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value
            is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever
            is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase
            letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin
            with a letter.

            Note that Prometheus {alert name} is a `valid Prometheus
            label
            names <https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels>`__,
            whereas Prometheus {rule group} is an unrestricted UTF-8
            string. This means that they cannot be stored as-is in user
            labels, because they may contain characters that are not
            allowed in user-label values.
        conditions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition]):
            A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are
            combined by AND or OR according to the ``combiner`` field.
            If the combined conditions evaluate to true, then an
            incident is created. A policy can have from one to six
            conditions. If ``condition_time_series_query_language`` is
            present, it must be the only ``condition``. If
            ``condition_monitoring_query_language`` is present, it must
            be the only ``condition``.
        combiner (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.ConditionCombinerType):
            How to combine the results of multiple conditions to
            determine if an incident should be opened. If
            ``condition_time_series_query_language`` is present, this
            must be ``COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED``.
        enabled (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Whether or not the policy is enabled. On
            write, the default interpretation if unset is
            that the policy is enabled. On read, clients
            should not make any assumption about the state
            if it has not been populated. The field should
            always be populated on List and Get operations,
            unless a field projection has been specified
            that strips it out.
        validity (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
            Read-only description of how the alerting
            policy is invalid. This field is only set when
            the alerting policy is invalid. An invalid
            alerting policy will not generate incidents.
        notification_channels (MutableSequence[str]):
            Identifies the notification channels to which notifications
            should be sent when incidents are opened or closed or when
            new violations occur on an already opened incident. Each
            element of this array corresponds to the ``name`` field in
            each of the
            [``NotificationChannel``][google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannel]
            objects that are returned from the
            [``ListNotificationChannels``]
            [google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.ListNotificationChannels]
            method. The format of the entries in this field is:

            ::

                projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
        creation_record (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.MutationRecord):
            A read-only record of the creation of the
            alerting policy. If provided in a call to create
            or update, this field will be ignored.
        mutation_record (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.MutationRecord):
            A read-only record of the most recent change
            to the alerting policy. If provided in a call to
            create or update, this field will be ignored.
        alert_strategy (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.AlertStrategy):
            Control over how this alerting policy's
            notification channels are notified.
        severity (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Severity):
            Optional. The severity of an alerting policy
            indicates how important incidents generated by
            that policy are. The severity level will be
            displayed on the Incident detail page and in
            notifications.

                    as the numerator.

                    The filter must specify the metric type and optionally may

                    all members of a group of resources).

                    When computing ratios, the ``aggregations`` and
                    ``denominator_aggregations`` fields must use the same
                    alignment period and produce time series that have the same
                    periodicity and labels.
                forecast_options (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition.MetricThreshold.ForecastOptions):

                    applied on each time series, with the time series on the
                    left-hand side and the threshold on the right-hand side.

                    The amount of time that a time series must violate the

                    that are a multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or 300
                    seconds--are supported. If an invalid value is given, an
                    error will be returned. When choosing a duration, it is
                    useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time
                    series data (which may also be affected by any alignments
                    specified in the ``aggregations`` field); a good duration is
                    long enough so that a single outlier does not generate
                    spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are
                    detected and alerted on quickly.

                    must hold in order for the condition to trigger. If

                evaluation_missing_data (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy.Condition.EvaluationMissingData):
                    A condition control that determines how metric-threshold
                    conditions are evaluated when data stops arriving. To use
                    this control, the value of the ``duration`` field must be

            `Prometheus Query Language
            (PromQL) <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/>`__.

            The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition message contains information
            from a Prometheus alerting rule and its associated rule group.

            A Prometheus alerting rule is described
            `here <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/>`__.
            The semantics of a Prometheus alerting rule is described
            `here <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#rule>`__.

            A Prometheus rule group is described
            `here <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/>`__.
            The semantics of a Prometheus rule group is described
            `here <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#rule_group>`__.

            Because Cloud Alerting has no representation of a Prometheus rule
            group resource, we must embed the information of the parent rule
            group inside each of the conditions that refer to it. We must also
            update the contents of all Prometheus alerts in case the information
            of their rule group changes.

            The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer combines the
            information of the corresponding rule group and alerting rule. The
            structure of the PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer
            does NOT mimic the structure of the Prometheus rule group and
            alerting rule YAML declarations. The
            PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer may change in the
            future to support future rule group and/or alerting rule features.
            There are no new such features at the present time (2023-06-26).

                duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
                    Optional. Alerts are considered firing once
                    their PromQL expression was evaluated to be
                    "true" for this long. Alerts whose PromQL

                    Must be a non-negative duration or missing.
                    This field is optional. Its default value is
                    zero.
                evaluation_interval (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
                    Optional. How often this rule should be
                    evaluated. Must be a positive multiple of 30
                    seconds or missing. This field is optional. Its
                    default value is 30 seconds. If this
                    PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition was generated

                    file.

                    populated correctly in order to refer to the
                    original Prometheus configuration file. The rule

                    string.

                    Optional. The alerting rule name of this alert in the
                    corresponding Prometheus configuration file.

                    Some external tools may require this field to be populated
                    correctly in order to refer to the original Prometheus
                    configuration file. The rule group name and the alert name
                    are necessary to update the relevant AlertPolicies in case
                    the definition of the rule group changes in the future.

                    This field is optional. If this field is not empty, then it
                    must be a `valid Prometheus label
