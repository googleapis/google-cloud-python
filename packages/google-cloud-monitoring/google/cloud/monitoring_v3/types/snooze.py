    active from ``interval.start_time`` through ``interval.end_time``.

        name (str):
            Required. The name of the ``Snooze``. The format is:

            The ID of the ``Snooze`` will be generated by the system.
        criteria (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Snooze.Criteria):
            Required. This defines the criteria for applying the
            ``Snooze``. See ``Criteria`` for more information.
        interval (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.TimeInterval):
            Required. The ``Snooze`` will be active from
            ``interval.start_time`` through ``interval.end_time``.
            ``interval.start_time`` cannot be in the past. There is a 15
            second clock skew to account for the time it takes for a
            request to reach the API from the UI.
        display_name (str):
            Required. A display name for the ``Snooze``. This can be, at
            most, 512 unicode characters.
