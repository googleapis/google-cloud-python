                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``

                ``[ALERT_POLICY_ID]`` value.

                policy, except for the following:

                -  The new policy will have the same
                   ``[ALERT_POLICY_ID]`` as the former policy. This
                   gives you continuity with the former policy in your
                   notifications and incidents.
                -  Conditions in the new policy will keep their former
                   ``[CONDITION_ID]`` if the supplied condition includes
                   the ``name`` field with that ``[CONDITION_ID]``. If
                   the supplied condition omits the ``name`` field, then
                   a new ``[CONDITION_ID]`` is created.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            alert_policy (:class:`google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.AlertPolicy`):
                Required. The updated alerting policy or the updated
                values for the fields listed in ``update_mask``. If
                ``update_mask`` is not empty, any fields in this policy
                that are not in ``update_mask`` are ignored.

                This corresponds to the ``alert_policy`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
