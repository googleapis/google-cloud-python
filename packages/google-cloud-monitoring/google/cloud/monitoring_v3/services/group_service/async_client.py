        Returns:
            google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Group:
                The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group
                   has a filter that is matched against monitored
                   resources and their associated metadata. If a group's
                   filter matches an available monitored resource, then
                   that resource is a member of that group. Groups can
                   contain any number of monitored resources, and each
                   monitored resource can be a member of any number of
                   groups.

                   Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The
                   parentName field identifies an optional parent for
                   each group. If a group has a parent, then the only
                   monitored resources available to be matched by the
                   group's filter are the resources contained in the
                   parent group. In other words, a group contains the
                   monitored resources that match its filter and the
                   filters of all the group's ancestors. A group without
                   a parent can contain any monitored resource.

                   For example, consider an infrastructure running a set
                   of instances with two user-defined tags:
                   "environment" and "role". A parent group has a
                   filter, environment="production". A child of that
                   parent group has a filter, role="transcoder". The
                   parent group contains all instances in the production
                   environment, regardless of their roles. The child
                   group contains instances that have the transcoder
                   role *and* are in the production environment.

                   The monitored resources contained in a group can
                   change at any moment, depending on what resources
                   exist and what filters are associated with the group
                   and its ancestors.

                The request object. The ``CreateGroup`` request.

                Required. The
                `project <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name>`__
                in which to create the group. The format is:

                ::

                    projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]

                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            group (:class:`google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Group`):
                Required. A group definition. It is an error to define
                the ``name`` field because the system assigns the name.

                This corresponds to the ``group`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Group:
                The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group
                   has a filter that is matched against monitored
                   resources and their associated metadata. If a group's
                   filter matches an available monitored resource, then
                   that resource is a member of that group. Groups can
                   contain any number of monitored resources, and each
                   monitored resource can be a member of any number of
                   groups.

                   Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The
                   parentName field identifies an optional parent for
                   each group. If a group has a parent, then the only
                   monitored resources available to be matched by the
                   group's filter are the resources contained in the
                   parent group. In other words, a group contains the
                   monitored resources that match its filter and the
                   filters of all the group's ancestors. A group without
                   a parent can contain any monitored resource.

                   For example, consider an infrastructure running a set
                   of instances with two user-defined tags:
                   "environment" and "role". A parent group has a
                   filter, environment="production". A child of that
                   parent group has a filter, role="transcoder". The
                   parent group contains all instances in the production
                   environment, regardless of their roles. The child
                   group contains instances that have the transcoder
                   role *and* are in the production environment.

                   The monitored resources contained in a group can
                   change at any moment, depending on what resources
                   exist and what filters are associated with the group
                   and its ancestors.

                The request object. The ``ListGroupMembers`` request.
            name (:class:`str`):
                Required. The group whose members are listed. The format
                is:

                ::

                    projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/groups/[GROUP_ID]

                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.monitoring_v3.services.group_service.pagers.ListGroupMembersAsyncPager:
                The ListGroupMembers response.
