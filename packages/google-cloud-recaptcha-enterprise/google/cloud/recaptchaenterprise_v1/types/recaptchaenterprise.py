            AUTHORIZATION_DECLINE (5):
                Indicates that the authorization attempt with
                the card issuer failed. The accompanying reasons
                can include Visa's '54' indicating that the card
                is expired, or '82' indicating that the CVV is
                incorrect.
            PAYMENT_CAPTURE (6):
                Indicates that the transaction is completed

                chargeback inquiry due to fraud for the
                transaction, requesting additional information
                before a fraud chargeback is officially issued
                and a formal chargeback notification is sent.
            CHARGEBACK_ALERT (10):
                Indicates that the merchant has received a
                chargeback alert due to fraud for the
                transaction. The process of resolving the
                dispute without involving the payment network is
                started.
            FRAUD_NOTIFICATION (11):
                Indicates that a fraud notification is issued for the
                transaction, sent by the payment instrument's issuing bank
                because the transaction appears to be fraudulent. We
                recommend including TC40 or SAFE data in the ``reason``
                field for this event type. For partial chargebacks, we
                recommend that you include an amount in the ``value`` field.
            CHARGEBACK (12):
                Indicates that the merchant is informed by the payment
                network that the transaction has entered the chargeback
                process due to fraud. Reason code examples include
                Discover's '6005' and '6041'. For partial chargebacks, we
                recommend that you include an amount in the ``value`` field.
            CHARGEBACK_REPRESENTMENT (13):
                Indicates that the transaction has entered the chargeback
                process due to fraud, and that the merchant has chosen to
                enter representment. Reason examples include Discover's
                '6005' and '6041'. For partial chargebacks, we recommend
                that you include an amount in the ``value`` field.
            CHARGEBACK_REVERSE (14):
                Indicates that the transaction has had a fraud chargeback
                which was illegitimate and was reversed as a result. For
                partial chargebacks, we recommend that you include an amount
                in the ``value`` field.
            REFUND_REQUEST (15):
                Indicates that the merchant has received a refund for a
                completed transaction. For partial refunds, we recommend
                that you include an amount in the ``value`` field. Reason
                example: 'TAX_EXEMPT' (partial refund of exempt tax)
            REFUND_DECLINE (16):
                Indicates that the merchant has received a refund request
                for this transaction, but that they have declined it. For
                partial refunds, we recommend that you include an amount in
                the ``value`` field. Reason example: 'TAX_EXEMPT' (partial
                refund of exempt tax)
            REFUND (17):
                Indicates that the completed transaction was refunded by the
                merchant. For partial refunds, we recommend that you include
                an amount in the ``value`` field. Reason example:
                'TAX_EXEMPT' (partial refund of exempt tax)
            REFUND_REVERSE (18):
                Indicates that the completed transaction was refunded by the
                merchant, and that this refund was reversed. For partial
                refunds, we recommend that you include an amount in the
