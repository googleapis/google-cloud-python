class TermsOfServiceAgreementState(proto.Message):
    r"""This resource represents the agreement state for a given account and
    terms of service kind. The state is as follows:

    -  If the merchant has accepted a terms of service:
       `accepted <TermsOfServiceAggrementState.accepted>`__ will be
       populated, otherwise it will be empty
    -  If the merchant must sign a terms of service:
       `required <TermsOfServiceAggrementState.required>`__ will be
       populated, otherwise it will be empty.

    Note that both `required <TermsOfServiceAggrementState.required>`__
    and `accepted <TermsOfServiceAggrementState.accepted>`__ can be
    present. In this case the ``accepted`` terms of services will have
    an expiration date set in the `valid_until <Accepted.valid_until>`__
    field. The ``required`` terms of services need to be accepted before
    ``valid_until`` in order for the account to continue having a valid
    agreement. When accepting new terms of services we expect 3Ps to
    display the text associated with the given terms of service
    agreement (the url to the file containing the text is added in the
    Required message below as `tos_file_uri <Accepted.tos_file_uri>`__.
    The actual acceptance of the terms of service is done by calling
    accept on the `TermsOfService <TermsOfService>`__ resource.
