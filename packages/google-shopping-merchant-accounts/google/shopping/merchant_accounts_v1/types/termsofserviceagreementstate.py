class TermsOfServiceAgreementState(proto.Message):
    r"""This resource represents the agreement state for a given account and
    terms of service kind. The state is as follows:

    -  If the business has accepted a terms of service,
       [``accepted``][google.shopping.merchant.accounts.v1.Accepted]
       will be populated, otherwise it will be empty
    -  If the business must sign a terms of service,
       [``required``][google.shopping.merchant.accounts.v1.Required]
       will be populated, otherwise it will be empty.

    Note that both ``required`` and ``accepted`` can be present. In this
    case the ``accepted`` terms of services will have an expiration date
    set in the
    [``valid_until``][google.shopping.merchant.accounts.v1.Accepted.valid_until]
    field. The ``required`` terms of services need to be accepted before
    ``valid_until`` in order for the account to continue having a valid
    agreement. When accepting new terms of services we expect
    third-party providers to display the text associated with the given
    terms of service agreement (the url to the file containing the text
    is added in the Required message below as
    [``tos_file_uri``][google.shopping.merchant.accounts.v1.Required.tos_file_uri]).
    The actual acceptance of the terms of service is done by calling
    accept on the
    [``TermsOfService``][google.shopping.merchant.accounts.v1.Accepted.terms_of_service]
    resource. ``valid_until`` field.
