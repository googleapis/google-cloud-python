class AccountRelationship(proto.Message):
    r"""The ``AccountRelationship`` message defines a formal connection
    between a merchant's account and a service provider's account. This
    relationship enables the provider to offer specific services to the
    business, such as product management or campaign management. It
    specifies the access rights and permissions to the business's data
    relevant to those services.

    Establishing an account relationship involves linking the merchant's
    account with a provider's account. The provider could be another
    Google account (like Google Ads or Google My Business) or a
    third-party platform (such as Shopify or WooCommerce).

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The resource name of the account relationship.
            Format: ``accounts/{account}/relationships/{relationship}``.
            For example, ``accounts/123456/relationships/567890``.
        provider (str):
            Immutable. The provider of the service. Either the reference
            to an account such as ``providers/123`` or a well-known

            all your account relationships with the same provider.

            For example, you might use ``account_id_alias`` to assign a
            friendly name to this relationship for easier identification
            in your systems.
