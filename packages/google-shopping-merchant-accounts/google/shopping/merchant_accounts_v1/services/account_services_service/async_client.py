                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be

                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                be of type `bytes`.

        Returns:
            google.shopping.merchant_accounts_v1.types.AccountService:
                The AccountService message represents a specific service that a provider
                   account offers to a Merchant Center account.

                   AccountService defines the permissions and
                   capabilities granted to the provider, allowing for
                   operations such as product management or campaign
                   management.

                   The lifecycle of an AccountService involves a
                   proposal phase, where one party suggests the service,
                   and an approval phase, where the other party accepts
                   or rejects it. This handshake mechanism ensures
                   mutual consent before any access is granted. This
                   mechanism safeguards both parties by ensuring that
                   access rights are granted appropriately and that both
                   the business and provider are aware of the services
                   enabled. In scenarios where a user is an admin of
                   both accounts, the approval can happen automatically.

                   The mutability of a service is also managed through
                   AccountService. Some services might be immutable, for
                   example, if they were established through other
                   systems or APIs, and you cannot alter them through
                   this API.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be

                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                be of type `bytes`.
