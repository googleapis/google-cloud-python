            then the message data will be treated as an opaque binary
            and no output format can be set on the Pipeline through the
            Pipeline.Destination.output_payload_format field. Any

                    Optional. The CEL expression used to modify how the
                    destination-bound HTTP request is constructed.

                    If a binding expression is not specified here, the message
                    is treated as a CloudEvent and is mapped to the HTTP request
                    according to the CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary
                    Content Mode
                    (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode).
                    In this representation, all fields except the ``data`` and
                    ``datacontenttype`` field on the message are mapped to HTTP
                    request headers with a prefix of ``ce-``.

                    To construct the HTTP request payload and the value of the
                    content-type HTTP header, the payload format is defined as
                    follows:

                    1) Use the output_payload_format_type on the
                       Pipeline.Destination if it is set, else:
                    2) Use the input_payload_format_type on the Pipeline if it
                       is set, else:
                    3) Treat the payload as opaque binary data.

                    The ``data`` field of the message is converted to the
                    payload format or left as-is for case 3) and then attached
                    as the payload of the HTTP request. The ``content-type``
                    header on the HTTP request is set to the payload format type
                    or left empty for case 3). However, if a mediation has
                    updated the ``datacontenttype`` field on the message so that
                    it is not the same as the payload format type but it is
                    still a prefix of the payload format type, then the
                    ``content-type`` header on the HTTP request is set to this
                    ``datacontenttype`` value. For example, if the
                    ``datacontenttype`` is "application/json" and the payload
                    format type is "application/json; charset=utf-8", then the
                    ``content-type`` header on the HTTP request is set to
                    "application/json; charset=utf-8".

                    If a non-empty binding expression is specified then this
                    expression is used to modify the default CloudEvent HTTP
                    Protocol Binding Binary Content representation. The result
                    of the CEL expression must be a map of key/value pairs which
                    is used as follows:

                    - If a map named ``headers`` exists on the result of the
                      expression, then its key/value pairs are directly mapped
                      to the HTTP request headers. The headers values are
                      constructed from the corresponding value type's canonical
                      representation. If the ``headers`` field doesn't exist
                      then the resulting HTTP request will be the headers of the
                      CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation
                      of the final message. Note: If the specified binding
                      expression, has updated the ``datacontenttype`` field on
                      the message so that it is not the same as the payload
                      format type but it is still a prefix of the payload format
                      type, then the ``content-type`` header in the ``headers``
                      map is set to this ``datacontenttype`` value.
                    - If a field named ``body`` exists on the result of the
                      expression then its value is directly mapped to the body
                      of the request. If the value of the ``body`` field is of
                      type bytes or string then it is used for the HTTP request
                      body as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is of
                      any other type then it is converted to a JSON string. If
                      the body field does not exist then the resulting payload
                      of the HTTP request will be data value of the CloudEvent
                      HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the
                      final message as described earlier.
                    - Any other fields in the resulting expression will be
                      ignored.

                    The CEL expression may access the incoming CloudEvent
                    message in its definition, as follows:

                    - The ``data`` field of the incoming CloudEvent message can
                      be accessed using the ``message.data`` value. Subfields of
                      ``message.data`` may also be accessed if an
                      input_payload_format has been specified on the Pipeline.
                    - Each attribute of the incoming CloudEvent message can be
                      accessed using the ``message.<key>`` value, where is
                      replaced with the name of the attribute.
                    - Existing headers can be accessed in the CEL expression
                      using the ``headers`` variable. The ``headers`` variable
                      defines a map of key/value pairs corresponding to the HTTP
                      headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
                      representation of the final message as described earlier.
                      For example, the following CEL expression can be used to
                      construct an HTTP request by adding an additional header
                      to the HTTP headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary
                      Content Mode representation of the final message and by
                      overwriting the body of the request:

                    ::

                       {
                         "headers": headers.merge({"new-header-key": "new-header-value"}),
                         "body": "new-body"
                       }

                    - The default binding for the message payload can be
                      accessed using the ``body`` variable. It conatins a string
                      representation of the message payload in the format
                      specified by the ``output_payload_format`` field. If the
                      ``input_payload_format`` field is not set, the ``body``
                      variable contains the same message payload bytes that were
                      published.

                    Additionally, the following CEL extension functions are
                    provided for use in this CEL expression:

                    - toBase64Url: map.toBase64Url() -> string

                      - Converts a CelValue to a base64url encoded string

                    - toJsonString: map.toJsonString() -> string

                      - Converts a CelValue to a JSON string

                    - merge: map1.merge(map2) -> map3

                      - Merges the passed CEL map with the existing CEL map the
                        function is applied to.
                      - If the same key exists in both maps, if the key's value
                        is type map both maps are merged else the value from the
                        passed map is used.

                    - denormalize: map.denormalize() -> map

                      - Denormalizes a CEL map such that every value of type map
                        or key in the map is expanded to return a single level
                        map.
                      - The resulting keys are "." separated indices of the map
                        keys.
                      - For example: { "a": 1, "b": { "c": 2, "d": 3 } "e": [4,
                        5] } .denormalize() -> { "a": 1, "b.c": 2, "b.d": 3,
                        "e.0": 4, "e.1": 5 }

                    - setField: map.setField(key, value) -> message

                      - Sets the field of the message with the given key to the
                        given value.
                      - If the field is not present it will be added.
                      - If the field is present it will be overwritten.
                      - The key can be a dot separated path to set a field in a
                        nested message.
                      - Key must be of type string.
                      - Value may be any valid type.

                    - removeFields: map.removeFields([key1, key2, ...]) ->
                      message

                      - Removes the fields of the map with the given keys.
                      - The keys can be a dot separated path to remove a field
                        in a nested message.
                      - If a key is not found it will be ignored.
                      - Keys must be of type string.

                    - toMap: [map1, map2, ...].toMap() -> map

                      - Converts a CEL list of CEL maps to a single CEL map

                    - toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat:
                      message.toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat() -> map

                      - Converts a message to the corresponding structure of
                        JSON format for CloudEvents.
                      - It converts ``data`` to destination payload format
                        specified in ``output_payload_format``. If
                        ``output_payload_format`` is not set, the data will
                        remain unchanged.
                      - It also sets the corresponding datacontenttype of the
                        CloudEvent, as indicated by ``output_payload_format``.
                        If no ``output_payload_format`` is set it will use the
                        value of the "datacontenttype" attribute on the
                        CloudEvent if present, else remove "datacontenttype"
                        attribute.
                      - This function expects that the content of the message
                        will adhere to the standard CloudEvent format. If it
                        doesn't then this function will fail.
                      - The result is a CEL map that corresponds to the JSON
                        representation of the CloudEvent. To convert that data
                        to a JSON string it can be chained with the toJsonString
                        function.

                    The Pipeline expects that the message it receives adheres to
                    the standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn't then the
                    outgoing message request may fail with a persistent error.

                        datacontenttype on the CloudEvent if present, else leave

                      - This function expects that the content of the message
                        will adhere to the standard CloudEvent format. If it
                        doesn't then this function will fail.
                      - The result is a CEL map that corresponds to the JSON
                        representation of the CloudEvent. To convert that data
                        to a JSON string it can be chained with the toJsonString
                        function.
