    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The resource name of the trigger. Must be unique
            within the location of the project and must be in
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/triggers/{trigger}``
            format.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server-assigned unique
            identifier for the trigger. The value is a UUID4
            string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until
            the resource is deleted.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The creation time.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last-modified time.
        event_filters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.EventFilter]):
            Required. Unordered list. The list of filters
            that applies to event attributes. Only events
            that match all the provided filters are sent to
            the destination.
        service_account (str):
            Optional. The IAM service account email associated with the
            trigger. The service account represents the identity of the
            trigger.

            The ``iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`` permission must be granted
            on the service account to allow a principal to impersonate
            the service account. For more information, see the `Roles
            and permissions </eventarc/docs/all-roles-permissions>`__
            page specific to the trigger destination.
        destination (google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.Destination):
            Required. Destination specifies where the
            events should be sent to.
        transport (google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.Transport):
            Optional. To deliver messages, Eventarc might
            use other Google Cloud products as a transport
            intermediary. This field contains a reference to
            that transport intermediary. This information
            can be used for debugging purposes.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. User labels attached to the
            triggers that can be used to group resources.
        channel (str):
            Optional. The name of the channel associated with the
            trigger in
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/channels/{channel}``
            format. You must provide a channel to receive events from
            Eventarc SaaS partners.
        conditions (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.StateCondition]):
            Output only. The reason(s) why a trigger is
            in FAILED state.
        event_data_content_type (str):
            Optional. EventDataContentType specifies the type of payload
            in MIME format that is expected from the CloudEvent data
            field. This is set to ``application/json`` if the value is
            not defined.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Whether or not this Trigger
            satisfies the requirements of physical zone
            separation
        etag (str):
            Output only. This checksum is computed by the
            server based on the value of other fields, and
            might be sent only on create requests to ensure
            that the client has an up-to-date value before
            proceeding.
