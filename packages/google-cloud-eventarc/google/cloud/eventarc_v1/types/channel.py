class Channel(proto.Message):
    r"""A representation of the Channel resource.
    A Channel is a resource on which event providers publish their
    events. The published events are delivered through the transport
    associated with the channel. Note that a channel is associated
    with exactly one event provider.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The resource name of the channel. Must be unique
            within the location on the project and must be in
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/channels/{channel_id}``
            format.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server assigned unique
            identifier for the channel. The value is a UUID4
            string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until
            the resource is deleted.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The creation time.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last-modified time.
        provider (str):
            The name of the event provider (e.g. Eventarc SaaS partner)
            associated with the channel. This provider will be granted
            permissions to publish events to the channel. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/providers/{provider_id}``.
        pubsub_topic (str):
            Output only. The name of the Pub/Sub topic created and
            managed by Eventarc system as a transport for the event
            delivery. Format: ``projects/{project}/topics/{topic_id}``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``transport``.
        state (google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.Channel.State):
            Output only. The state of a Channel.
        activation_token (str):
            Output only. The activation token for the
            channel. The token must be used by the provider
            to register the channel for publishing.
        crypto_key_name (str):
            Optional. Resource name of a KMS crypto key (managed by the
            user) used to encrypt/decrypt their event data.

            It must match the pattern
            ``projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*``.

    class State(proto.Enum):
        r"""State lists all the possible states of a Channel

        Values:
            STATE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Default value. This value is unused.
            PENDING (1):
                The PENDING state indicates that a Channel
                has been created successfully and there is a new
                activation token available for the subscriber to
                use to convey the Channel to the provider in
                order to create a Connection.
            ACTIVE (2):
                The ACTIVE state indicates that a Channel has
                been successfully connected with the event
                provider. An ACTIVE Channel is ready to receive
                and route events from the event provider.
            INACTIVE (3):
                The INACTIVE state indicates that the Channel
                cannot receive events permanently. There are two
                possible cases this state can happen:

                1. The SaaS provider disconnected from this
                    Channel.
                2. The Channel activation token has expired but
                    the SaaS provider    wasn't connected.

                To re-establish a Connection with a provider,
                the subscriber should create a new Channel and
                give it to the provider.
