    a MessageBus.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. Resource name of the form
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/googleApiSources/{google_api_source}

            Output only. Server assigned unique
            identifier for the channel. The value is a UUID4
            string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until
            the resource is deleted.
        etag (str):
            Output only. This checksum is computed by the
            server based on the value of other fields, and
            might be sent only on update and delete requests
            to ensure that the client has an up-to-date
            value before proceeding.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The creation time.

        display_name (str):
            Optional. Resource display name.
        destination (str):
            Required. Destination is the message bus that the
            GoogleApiSource is delivering to. It must be point to the
            full resource name of a MessageBus. Format:
            "projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{region}/messagesBuses/{MESSAGE_BUS_ID)
        crypto_key_name (str):
            Optional. Resource name of a KMS crypto key (managed by the
            user) used to encrypt/decrypt their event data.

            It must match the pattern
            ``projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*``.

            Optional. Config to enable subscribing to
            events from all projects in the
            GoogleApiSource's org.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``wide_scope_subscription``.

            Optional. Config to enable subscribing to all

            All the projects must be in the same org as the
            GoogleApiSource.
