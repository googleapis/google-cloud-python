    tenant is a group or entity that shares common access with
    specific privileges for resources like profiles. Customer may
    create multiple tenants to provide data isolation for different
    groups.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required during tenant update.

            The resource name for a tenant. This is generated by the
            service when a tenant is created.

            The format is "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}",
            for example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar".
        external_id (str):
            Required. Client side tenant identifier, used
            to uniquely identify the tenant.

            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        usage_type (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Tenant.DataUsageType):
            Indicates whether data owned by this tenant may be used to
            provide product improvements across other tenants.

            [Profile.custom_attributes][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.custom_attributes],
            whose corresponding ``string_values`` are used in keyword
            searches. Profiles with ``string_values`` under these
            specified field keys are returned if any of the values match
            the search keyword. Custom field values with parenthesis,
            brackets and special symbols are not searchable as-is, and
            must be surrounded by quotes.
