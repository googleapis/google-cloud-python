class Profile(proto.Message):
    r"""A resource that represents the profile for a job candidate
    (also referred to as a "single-source profile").

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required during profile update.

            Resource name assigned to a profile by the API.

            The format is
            "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/profiles/{profile_id}",
            for example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar/profiles/baz".
        external_id (str):
            Profile's id in client system, if available. This value is
            unique for each profile inside a tenant. An error is thrown
            if another profile with the same external_id is created.

            The maximum number of bytes allowed is 100.
        source (str):
            The source description indicating where the
            profile is acquired.
            For example, if a candidate profile is acquired
            from a resume, the user can input "resume" here
            to indicate the source.

            The maximum number of bytes allowed is 100.
        uri (str):
            The URI set by clients that links to this
            profile's client-side copy.
            The maximum number of bytes allowed is 4000.
        group_id (str):
            The cluster id of the profile to associate with other
            profile(s) for the same candidate.

            This field should be generated by the customer. If a value
            is not provided, a random UUID is assigned to this field of
            the profile.

            This is used to link multiple profiles to the same
            candidate. For example, a client has a candidate with two
            profiles, where one was created recently and the other one
            was created 5 years ago. These two profiles may be very
            different. The clients can create the first profile and get
            a generated
            [group_id][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.group_id],
            and assign it when the second profile is created, indicating
            these two profiles are referring to the same candidate.
        is_hirable (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Indicates the hirable status of the
            candidate.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp when the profile was first
            created at this source.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp when the profile was last
            updated at this source.
        candidate_update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp when the profile was last updated as a result
            of a direct or indirect action by a candidate.

            These actions include:

            -  Direct actions such as the candidate submitting a new
               resume as part of a job application to the agency, using
               a self-service tool such as a website to update their
               profile, and so on.
            -  Indirect actions by the candidate such as uploading a
               resume to a job board that is collected by the agency
               through a feed, providing a resume to a recruiter who
               then uploads it into the ATS, and so on.
            -  Updates made to the candidate's profile by the recruiter
               as a result of interacting with the candidate (for
               example adding a skill or work preference, and so on).
               Changes to
               [recruiting_notes][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.recruiting_notes]
               are specifically excluded from this action type.

            Note:
            [candidate_update_time][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.candidate_update_time]
            must be greater than or equal to
            [resume_update_time][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.resume_update_time]
            or an error is thrown.
        resume_update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp when the candidate's resume was added or
            updated on the candidate's profile. Whether that resume was
            directly uploaded by a candidate, pulled from a 3rd party
            job board feed, added by a recruiter, and so on.

            If this field is updated, it's expected that
            [resume][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.resume] is
            provided in the create or update calls.
        resume (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Resume):
            The resume representing this profile.
        person_names (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.PersonName]):
            The names of the candidate this profile
            references.
            Currently only one person name is supported.
        addresses (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Address]):
            The candidate's postal addresses. It's highly recommended to
            input this information as accurately as possible to help
            improve search quality. Here are some recommendations:

            -  Provide
               [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               if possible, especially if the address is PERSONAL.
               During a search only personal addresses are considered.
               If there is no such address, all addresses with
               unspecified usage are assumed to be personal.
            -  Provide
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               for the current address if possible. During a search,
               only current addresses are considered. If there is no
               such address, all addresses are assumed to be current.

            When displaying a candidate's addresses, it is sometimes
            desirable to limit the number of addresses shown. In these
            cases we recommend that you display the addresses in the
            following order of priority:

            1. [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is PERSONAL and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is true.
            2. [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is PERSONAL and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is false or not set.
            3. [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is true.
            4. [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is false or not set.
        email_addresses (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Email]):
            The candidate's email addresses.
        phone_numbers (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Phone]):

            [addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses],
            [email_addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.email_addresses],
            [phone_numbers][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.phone_numbers]
            and
            [personal_uris][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.personal_uris].
            For example, Hang-out, Skype.
        employment_records (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.EmploymentRecord]):
            The employment history records of the candidate. It's highly
            recommended to input this information as accurately as
            possible to help improve search quality. Here are some
            recommendations:

            -  Specify the start and end dates of the employment
               records.
            -  List different employment types separately, no matter how
               minor the change is. For example, only job title is
               changed from "software engineer" to "senior software
               engineer".
            -  Provide
               [EmploymentRecord.is_current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EmploymentRecord.is_current]
               for the current employment if possible. If not, it's
               inferred from user inputs.

            The limitation for max number of employment records is 100.
        education_records (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.EducationRecord]):
            The education history record of the candidate. It's highly
            recommended to input this information as accurately as
            possible to help improve search quality. Here are some
            recommendations:

            -  Specify the start and end dates of the education records.
            -  List each education type separately, no matter how minor
               the change is. For example, the profile contains the
               education experience from the same school but different
               degrees.
            -  Provide
               [EducationRecord.is_current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EducationRecord.is_current]
               for the current education if possible. If not, it's
               inferred from user inputs.

            The limitation for max number of education records is 100.
        skills (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Skill]):
            The skill set of the candidate. It's highly
            recommended to provide as much information as
            possible to help improve the search quality.
            The limitation for max number of skills is 500.
        activities (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Activity]):
            The individual or collaborative activities which the
            candidate has participated in, for example, open-source
            projects, class assignments that aren't listed in
            [employment_records][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.employment_records].

            The limitation for max number of activities is 50.
        publications (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Publication]):
            The publications published by the candidate.
            The limitation for max number of publications is
            50.
        patents (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Patent]):
            The patents acquired by the candidate.
        certifications (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Certification]):

        custom_attributes (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Profile.CustomAttributesEntry]):
            A map of fields to hold both filterable and non-filterable
            custom profile attributes that aren't covered by the
            provided structured fields. See
            [CustomAttribute][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.CustomAttribute]
            for more details.

            At most 100 filterable and at most 100 unfilterable keys are
            supported. If limit is exceeded, an error is thrown. Custom
            attributes are ``unfilterable`` by default. These are
            filterable when the ``filterable`` flag is set to ``true``.

            Numeric custom attributes: each key can only map to one
            numeric value, otherwise an error is thrown. Client can also
            filter on numeric custom attributes using '>', '<' or '='
            operators.

            String custom attributes: each key can map up to 50 string
            values. For filterable string value, each value has a byte
            size of no more than 256B. For unfilterable string values,
            the maximum byte size of a single key is 64B. An error is

            Output only. Indicates if a summarized
            profile was created as part of the profile
            creation API call. This flag does not indicate
            whether a profile is searchable or not.
        keyword_snippet (str):
            Output only. Keyword snippet shows how the search result is
            related to a search query. This is only returned in
            [SearchProfilesResponse][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchProfilesResponse].
        availability_signals (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.AvailabilitySignal]):
            Output only. Candidate's availability
            signals.
        derived_addresses (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Location]):
            Output only. Derived locations of the profile, resolved from
            [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses].

            [derived_addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.derived_addresses]
            are exactly matched to
            [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses]
