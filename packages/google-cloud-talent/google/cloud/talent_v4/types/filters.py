    r"""The query required to perform a search query.

    Attributes:
        query (str):
            The query string that matches against the job
            title, description, and location fields.

            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        query_language_code (str):
            The language code of
            [query][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobQuery.query]. For example,
            "en-US". This field helps to better interpret the query.

            If a value isn't specified, the query language code is
            automatically detected, which may not be accurate.

            Language code should be in BCP-47 format, such as "en-US" or
            "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Tags for Identifying
            Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__.
        companies (MutableSequence[str]):
            This filter specifies the company entities to search
            against.

            If a value isn't specified, jobs are searched for against
            all companies.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs are searched against
            the companies specified.

            The format is
            "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}".
            For example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz".

            At most 20 company filters are allowed.
        location_filters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.talent_v4.types.LocationFilter]):
            The location filter specifies geo-regions containing the
            jobs to search against. See
            [LocationFilter][google.cloud.talent.v4.LocationFilter] for
            more information.

            If a location value isn't specified, jobs fitting the other
            search criteria are retrieved regardless of where they're
            located.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs are retrieved from
            any of the specified locations. If different values are
            specified for the
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            parameter, the maximum provided distance is used for all
            locations.

            At most 5 location filters are allowed.
        job_categories (MutableSequence[google.cloud.talent_v4.types.JobCategory]):
            The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to
            search against. See
            [JobCategory][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobCategory] for more
            information.

            If a value isn't specified, jobs from any category are
            searched against.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the
            specified categories are searched against.
        commute_filter (google.cloud.talent_v4.types.CommuteFilter):
            Allows filtering jobs by commute time with different travel
            methods (for example, driving or public transit).

            Note: This only works when you specify a
            [CommuteMethod][google.cloud.talent.v4.CommuteMethod]. In
            this case,
            [location_filters][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobQuery.location_filters]
            is ignored.

            Currently we don't support sorting by commute time.
        company_display_names (MutableSequence[str]):
            This filter specifies the company
            [Company.display_name][google.cloud.talent.v4.Company.display_name]
            of the jobs to search against. The company name must match
            the value exactly.

            Alternatively, the value being searched for can be wrapped
            in different match operators. ``SUBSTRING_MATCH([value])``
            The company name must contain a case insensitive substring
            match of the value. Using this function may increase
            latency.

            Sample Value: ``SUBSTRING_MATCH(google)``

            ``MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH([value])`` The value will be
            treated as a multi word token and the company name must
            contain a case insensitive match of the value. Using this
            function may increase latency.

            Sample Value: ``MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH(google)``

            If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results
            are associated with any company.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search
            results may be associated with any of the specified
            companies.

            At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.
        compensation_filter (google.cloud.talent_v4.types.CompensationFilter):
            This search filter is applied only to
            [Job.compensation_info][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.compensation_info].
            For example, if the filter is specified as "Hourly job with
            per-hour compensation > $15", only jobs meeting these
            criteria are searched. If a filter isn't defined, all open
            jobs are searched.
        custom_attribute_filter (str):
            This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against
            the
            [Job.custom_attributes][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.custom_attributes]
            marked as ``filterable``.

            The syntax for this expression is a subset of SQL syntax.

            Supported operators are: ``=``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``,
            ``>``, and ``>=`` where the left of the operator is a custom
            field key and the right of the operator is a number or a
            quoted string. You must escape backslash (\) and quote (")
            characters.

            Supported functions are ``LOWER([field_name])`` to perform a
            case insensitive match and ``EMPTY([field_name])`` to filter
            on the existence of a key.

            Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3
            levels of nesting (for example, "((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D)
            AND E"), a maximum of 100 comparisons or functions are
            allowed in the expression. The expression must be < 10000
            bytes in length.

            Sample Query:
            ``(LOWER(driving_license)="class \"a\"" OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND driving_years > 10``
        disable_spell_check (bool):
            This flag controls the spell-check feature.
            If false, the service attempts to correct a
            misspelled query, for example, "enginee" is
            corrected to "engineer".

            Defaults to false: a spell check is performed.
        employment_types (MutableSequence[google.cloud.talent_v4.types.EmploymentType]):
            The employment type filter specifies the employment type of
            jobs to search against, such as
            [EmploymentType.FULL_TIME][google.cloud.talent.v4.EmploymentType.FULL_TIME].

            If a value isn't specified, jobs in the search results
            includes any employment type.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results
            include any of the specified employment types.
        language_codes (MutableSequence[str]):
            This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against,
            for example, "en-US".

            If a value isn't specified, the search results can contain
            jobs in any locale.

            Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as "en-US"
            or "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Tags for
            Identifying
            Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__.

            At most 10 language code filters are allowed.
        publish_time_range (google.cloud.talent_v4.types.TimestampRange):
            Jobs published within a range specified by
            this filter are searched against.
        excluded_jobs (MutableSequence[str]):
            This filter specifies a list of job names to
            be excluded during search.
            At most 400 excluded job names are allowed.

        distance_in_miles (float):

            larger.

            Allows the client to return jobs without a set location,
            specifically, telecommuting jobs (telecommuting is
            considered by the service as a special location).

        commute_method (google.cloud.talent_v4.types.CommuteMethod):
            Required. The method of transportation to
            calculate the commute time for.
        start_coordinates (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            Required. The latitude and longitude of the
            location to calculate the commute time from.
        travel_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Required. The maximum travel time in seconds. The maximum
            allowed value is ``3600s`` (one hour). Format is ``123s``.
        allow_imprecise_addresses (bool):
            If ``true``, jobs without street level addresses may also be
            returned. For city level addresses, the city center is used.
            For state and coarser level addresses, text matching is
            used. If this field is set to ``false`` or isn't specified,
            only jobs that include street level addresses will be
            returned by commute search.
        road_traffic (google.cloud.talent_v4.types.CommuteFilter.RoadTraffic):
            Specifies the traffic density to use when
            calculating commute time.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``traffic_option``.
        departure_time (google.type.timeofday_pb2.TimeOfDay):
            The departure time used to calculate traffic impact,
            represented as
            [google.type.TimeOfDay][google.type.TimeOfDay] in local time
