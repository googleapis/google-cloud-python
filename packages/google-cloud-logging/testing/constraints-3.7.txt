# This constraints file is used to check that lower bounds
# are correct in setup.py
# List all library dependencies and extras in this file.
# Pin the version to the lower bound.
# e.g., if setup.py has "google-cloud-foo >= 1.14.0, < 2.0.0dev",
# Then this file should have google-cloud-foo==1.14.0
google-api-core==1.34.1
google-auth==2.14.1
proto-plus==1.22.0
protobuf==3.20.2
