# We use the constraints file for the latest Python version
# (currently this file) to check that the latest
# major versions of dependencies are supported in setup.py.
# List all library dependencies and extras in this file.
# Require the latest major version be installed for each dependency.
# e.g., if setup.py has "google-cloud-foo >= 1.14.0, < 2.0.0",
# Then this file should have google-cloud-foo>=1
google-api-core>=2
google-auth>=2
proto-plus>=1
protobuf>=6
