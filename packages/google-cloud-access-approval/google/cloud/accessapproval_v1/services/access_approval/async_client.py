    """This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
    Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:

    -  The API has a collection of
       [ApprovalRequest][google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest]
       resources, named ``approvalRequests/{approval_request}``
    -  The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization,
       named ``accessApprovalSettings``

    The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined
    at the Project/Folder/Organization level in the
    accessApprovalSettings, when there is a pending ApprovalRequest for
    them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can also optionally be
    published to a Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer (contact support
    if you would like to enable Pub/Sub notifications).

    ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personnel can
    only access the indicated resource or resources if the request is
    approved (subject to some exclusions:
    https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).

    Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may
    not be able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any
    support response times may be dramatically increased. As such the
    SLAs do not apply to any service disruption to the extent impacted
    by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do not enable Access Approval
    for projects where you may require high service availability and
    rapid response by Google Cloud Support.

    After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be
    taken on it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or
    with no activity for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an
    approval expires, the request is considered dismissed.

    If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.

                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

            update_mask (:class:`google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask`):
                The update mask applies to the settings. Only the top
                level fields of AccessApprovalSettings
                (notification_emails & enrolled_services) are supported.
                For each field, if it is included, the currently stored
                value will be entirely overwritten with the value of the
                field passed in this request.

                For the ``FieldMask`` definition, see
                https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#fieldmask
                If this field is left unset, only the
                notification_emails field will be updated.

                This corresponds to the ``update_mask`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
