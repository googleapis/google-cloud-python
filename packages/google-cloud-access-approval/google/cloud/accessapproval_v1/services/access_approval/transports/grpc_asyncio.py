class AccessApprovalGrpcAsyncIOTransport(AccessApprovalTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for AccessApproval.

    This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
    Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:

    -  The API has a collection of
       [ApprovalRequest][google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest]
       resources, named ``approvalRequests/{approval_request_id}``
    -  The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization,
       named ``accessApprovalSettings``

    The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined
    at the Project/Folder/Organization level in the
    accessApprovalSettings, when there is a pending ApprovalRequest for
    them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can also optionally be
    published to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer (for Beta,
    the Pub/Sub setup is managed manually).

    ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personel can
    only access the indicated resource or resources if the request is
    approved (subject to some exclusions:
    https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).

    Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may
    not be able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any
    support response times may be dramatically increased. As such the
    SLAs do not apply to any service disruption to the extent impacted
    by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do not enable Access Approval
    for projects where you may require high service availability and
    rapid response by Google Cloud Support.

    After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be
    taken on it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or
    with no activity for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an
    approval expires, the request is considered dismissed.

    If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

        Deletes the settings associated with a project,
        folder, or organization. This will have the effect of
        disabling Access Approval for the project, folder, or
        organization, but only if all ancestors also have Access
        Approval disabled. If Access Approval is enabled at a
        higher level of the hierarchy, then Access Approval will
        still be enabled at this level as the settings are
        inherited.

                A function that, when called, will call the underlying RPC
