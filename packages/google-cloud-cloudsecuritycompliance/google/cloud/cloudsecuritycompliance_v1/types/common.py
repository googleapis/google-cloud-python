    Values:
        SEVERITY_UNSPECIFIED (0):
            Default value. This value is unused.
        CRITICAL (1):
            A critical vulnerability is easily
            discoverable by an external actor, exploitable,
            and results in the direct ability to execute
            arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise
            gain additional access and privileges to cloud
            resources and workloads. Examples include
            publicly accessible unprotected user data and
            public SSH access with weak or no passwords.

            A critical threat is a threat that can access,
            modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized
            code within existing resources.
        HIGH (2):
            A high-risk vulnerability can be easily
            discovered and exploited in combination with
            other vulnerabilities to gain direct access and
            the ability to execute arbitrary code,
            exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional
            access and privileges to cloud resources and
            workloads. An example is a database with weak or
            no passwords that is only accessible internally.
            This database could easily be compromised by an
            actor that had access to the internal network.

            A high-risk threat is a threat that can create
            new computational resources in an environment
            but can't access data or execute code in
            existing resources.
        MEDIUM (3):
            A medium-risk vulnerability can be used by an
            actor to gain access to resources or privileges
            that enable them to eventually (through multiple
            steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the
            ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate
            data. An example is a service account with
            access to more projects than it should have. If
            an actor gains access to the service account,
            they could potentially use that access to
            manipulate a project the service account was not
            intended to.

            A medium-risk threat can cause operational
            impact but might not access data or execute
            unauthorized code.
        LOW (4):
            A low-risk vulnerability hampers a security
            organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities
            or active threats in their deployment, or
            prevents the root cause investigation of
            security issues. An example is monitoring and
            logs being disabled for resource configurations
            and access.

            A low-risk threat is a threat that has obtained
            minimal access to an environment but can't
            access data, execute code, or create resources.
