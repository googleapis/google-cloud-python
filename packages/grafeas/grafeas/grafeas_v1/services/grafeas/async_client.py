    Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker

    Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An
    ``Occurrence`` contains information about a specific analysis
    instance on a resource. An occurrence refers to a ``Note``. A note
    contains details describing the analysis and is generally stored in
    a separate project, called a ``Provider``. Multiple occurrences can
    refer to the same note.

    For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In
