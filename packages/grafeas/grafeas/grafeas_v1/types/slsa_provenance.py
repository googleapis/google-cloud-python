        materials (MutableSequence[grafeas.grafeas_v1.types.SlsaProvenance.Material]):
            The collection of artifacts that influenced
            the build including sources, dependencies, build
            tools, base images, and so on. This is

    class SlsaRecipe(proto.Message):
        r"""Steps taken to build the artifact.
        For a TaskRun, typically each container corresponds to one step
        in the recipe.

        Attributes:
            type_ (str):
                URI indicating what type of recipe was
                performed. It determines the meaning of
                recipe.entryPoint, recipe.arguments,
                recipe.environment, and materials.
            defined_in_material (int):
                Index in materials containing the recipe
                steps that are not implied by recipe.type. For
                example, if the recipe type were "make", then
                this would point to the source containing the
                Makefile, not the make program itself. Set to -1
                if the recipe doesn't come from a material, as
                zero is default unset value for int64.
            entry_point (str):
                String identifying the entry point into the
                build. This is often a path to a configuration
                file and/or a target label within that file. The
                syntax and meaning are defined by recipe.type.
                For example, if the recipe type were "make",
                then this would reference the directory in which
                to run make as well as which target to use.
            arguments (google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any):
                Collection of all external inputs that
                influenced the build on top of
                recipe.definedInMaterial and recipe.entryPoint.
                For example, if the recipe type were "make",
                then this might be the flags passed to make
                aside from the target, which is captured in
                recipe.entryPoint. Depending on the recipe Type,
                the structure may be different.
            environment (google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any):
                Any other builder-controlled inputs necessary
                for correctly evaluating the recipe. Usually
                only needed for reproducing the build but not
                evaluated as part of policy. Depending on the
                recipe Type, the structure may be different.
