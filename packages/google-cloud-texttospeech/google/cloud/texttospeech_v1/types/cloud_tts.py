            specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as

            other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error.
        pitch (float):
            Optional. Input only. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0,

            pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original
            pitch.
        volume_gain_db (float):

            native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range
            [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will
