                Custom options for the client.

                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is
                currently not supported for mTLS.

            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
