    Performs management operations on Bare Metal Solution servers.

    The ``baremetalsolution.googleapis.com`` service provides management
    capabilities for Bare Metal Solution servers. To access the API
    methods, you must assign Bare Metal Solution IAM roles containing
    the desired permissions to your staff in your Google Cloud project.
    You must also enable the Bare Metal Solution API. Once enabled, the
    methods act upon specific servers in your Bare Metal Solution
    environment.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
