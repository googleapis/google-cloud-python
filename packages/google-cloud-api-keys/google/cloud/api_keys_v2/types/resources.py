class Key(proto.Message):

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. The resource name of the key. The ``name`` has
            the form:
            ``projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/keys/<KEY_ID>``.
            For example:
            ``projects/123456867718/locations/global/keys/b7ff1f9f-8275-410a-94dd-3855ee9b5dd2``

            NOTE: Key is a global resource; hence the only supported
            value for location is ``global``.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Unique id in UUID4 format.
        display_name (str):
            Human-readable display name of this key that
            you can modify. The maximum length is 63
            characters.
        key_string (str):
            Output only. An encrypted and signed value held by this key.
            This field can be accessed only through the ``GetKeyString``
            method.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. A timestamp identifying the time
            this key was originally created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. A timestamp identifying the time
            this key was last updated.
        delete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. A timestamp when this key was
            deleted. If the resource is not deleted, this
            must be empty.
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Annotations is an unstructured key-value map
            stored with a policy that may be set by external
            tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.
            They are not queryable and should be preserved
            when modifying objects.
        restrictions (google.cloud.api_keys_v2.types.Restrictions):
            Key restrictions.
        etag (str):
            Output only. A checksum computed by the
            server based on the current value of the Key
            resource. This may be sent on update and delete
            requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date
