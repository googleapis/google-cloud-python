"""Test suite covering edge cases, stream boundaries, retry interactions, and sync/async parity.

These tests evaluate:
1. Stream continuity and subsequent chunk delivery following full/partial chunk recovery.
2. Parity in return types, retry configuration, and exception handling between sync and async.
3. Memory efficiency when consuming streaming iterables.
4. Coordination of retry policies, backoffs, and timeout handling during transport interruptions.

        after the server has actually committed all 100 bytes, the status query returns

        If `_reposition_stream_offset` leaves a non-``None`` 0-length buffer in place instead
        of resetting `_buffered_chunk = None`, the next transmission attempt treats that empty

    Why this test is needed:
        When a chunk upload fails with a transient 503 error, recovery involves querying
        the server offset before retransmitting. If inner helper methods wrapped their own
        independent retry loops around chunk transmission and recovery, a single transient
        failure would trigger compounded backoff sleeps across multiple layers. Only the
        outer streaming retry loop should schedule backoff delays.
