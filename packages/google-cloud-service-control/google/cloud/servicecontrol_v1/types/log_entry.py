class LogEntry(proto.Message):
    r"""An individual log entry.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The log to which this log entry belongs. Examples:
            ``"syslog"``, ``"book_log"``.
        timestamp (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time the event described by the log entry
            occurred. If omitted, defaults to operation
            start time.
        severity (google.logging.type.log_severity_pb2.LogSeverity):
            The severity of the log entry. The default value is
            ``LogSeverity.DEFAULT``.
        http_request (google.cloud.servicecontrol_v1.types.HttpRequest):
            Optional. Information about the HTTP request
            associated with this log entry, if applicable.
        trace (str):
            Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log
            entry, if any. If this field contains a relative resource
            name, you can assume the name is relative to
            ``//tracing.googleapis.com``. Example:
            ``projects/my-projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824``
        insert_id (str):
            A unique ID for the log entry used for deduplication. If
            omitted, the implementation will generate one based on
            operation_id.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            A set of user-defined (key, value) data that
            provides additional information about the log
            entry.
        proto_payload (google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any):
            The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer that
            is expressed as a JSON object. The only accepted type
            currently is [AuditLog][google.cloud.audit.AuditLog].

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload``.
        text_payload (str):
            The log entry payload, represented as a
            Unicode string (UTF-8).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload``.
        struct_payload (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Struct):
            The log entry payload, represented as a
            structure that is expressed as a JSON object.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload``.
        operation (google.cloud.servicecontrol_v1.types.LogEntryOperation):
            Optional. Information about an operation
            associated with the log entry, if applicable.
        source_location (google.cloud.servicecontrol_v1.types.LogEntrySourceLocation):
            Optional. Source code location information
            associated with the log entry, if any.
