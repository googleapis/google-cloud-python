class Distribution(proto.Message):
    r"""Distribution represents a frequency distribution of double-valued
    sample points. It contains the size of the population of sample
    points plus additional optional information:

    -  the arithmetic mean of the samples
    -  the minimum and maximum of the samples
    -  the sum-squared-deviation of the samples, used to compute
       variance
    -  a histogram of the values of the sample points

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        count (int):
            The total number of samples in the
            distribution. Must be >= 0.
        mean (float):
            The arithmetic mean of the samples in the distribution. If
            ``count`` is zero then this field must be zero.
        minimum (float):
            The minimum of the population of values. Ignored if
            ``count`` is zero.
        maximum (float):
            The maximum of the population of values. Ignored if
            ``count`` is zero.
        sum_of_squared_deviation (float):
            The sum of squared deviations from the mean:
            Sum[i=1..count]((x_i - mean)^2) where each x_i is a sample
            values. If ``count`` is zero then this field must be zero,
            otherwise validation of the request fails.
        bucket_counts (MutableSequence[int]):
            The number of samples in each histogram bucket.
            ``bucket_counts`` are optional. If present, they must sum to
            the ``count`` value.

            The buckets are defined below in ``bucket_option``. There
            are N buckets. ``bucket_counts[0]`` is the number of samples
            in the underflow bucket. ``bucket_counts[1]`` to
            ``bucket_counts[N-1]`` are the numbers of samples in each of
            the finite buckets. And
            ``bucket_counts[N] is the number of samples in the overflow bucket. See the comments of``\ bucket_option\`
            below for more details.

            Any suffix of trailing zeros may be omitted.
        linear_buckets (google.cloud.servicecontrol_v1.types.Distribution.LinearBuckets):
            Buckets with constant width.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``bucket_option``.
        exponential_buckets (google.cloud.servicecontrol_v1.types.Distribution.ExponentialBuckets):
            Buckets with exponentially growing width.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``bucket_option``.
        explicit_buckets (google.cloud.servicecontrol_v1.types.Distribution.ExplicitBuckets):
            Buckets with arbitrary user-provided width.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``bucket_option``.
        exemplars (MutableSequence[google.api.distribution_pb2.Exemplar]):
