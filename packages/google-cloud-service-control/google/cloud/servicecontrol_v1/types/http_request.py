class HttpRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""A common proto for logging HTTP requests. Only contains
    semantics defined by the HTTP specification. Product-specific
    logging information MUST be defined in a separate message.

    Attributes:
        request_method (str):
            The request method. Examples: ``"GET"``, ``"HEAD"``,
            ``"PUT"``, ``"POST"``.
        request_url (str):
            The scheme (http, https), the host name, the path, and the
            query portion of the URL that was requested. Example:
            ``"http://example.com/some/info?color=red"``.
        request_size (int):
            The size of the HTTP request message in
            bytes, including the request headers and the
            request body.
        status (int):
            The response code indicating the status of
            the response. Examples: 200, 404.
        response_size (int):
            The size of the HTTP response message sent
            back to the client, in bytes, including the
            response headers and the response body.
        user_agent (str):
            The user agent sent by the client. Example:
            ``"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; Q312461; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)"``.
        remote_ip (str):
            The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the client that issued the
            HTTP request. Examples: ``"192.168.1.1"``,
            ``"FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329"``.
        server_ip (str):
            The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the origin
            server that the request was sent to.
        referer (str):
            The referer URL of the request, as defined in `HTTP/1.1
            Header Field
            Definitions <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`__.
        latency (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The request processing latency on the server,
            from the time the request was received until the
            response was sent.
        cache_lookup (bool):
            Whether or not a cache lookup was attempted.
        cache_hit (bool):
            Whether or not an entity was served from
            cache (with or without validation).
        cache_validated_with_origin_server (bool):
            Whether or not the response was validated with the origin
            server before being served from cache. This field is only
            meaningful if ``cache_hit`` is True.
        cache_fill_bytes (int):
            The number of HTTP response bytes inserted
            into cache. Set only when a cache fill was
            attempted.
        protocol (str):
            Protocol used for the request. Examples:
            "HTTP/1.1", "HTTP/2", "websocket".
