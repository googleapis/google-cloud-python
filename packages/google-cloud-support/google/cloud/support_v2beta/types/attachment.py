    r"""An Attachment contains metadata about a file that was uploaded to a
    case - it is NOT a file itself. That being said, the name of an
    Attachment object can be used to download its accompanying file
    through the ``media.download`` endpoint.

    While attachments can be uploaded in the console at the same time as
    a comment, they're associated on a "case" level, not a "comment"
    level.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. Identifier. The resource name of
            the attachment.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the attachment
            was created.
        creator (google.cloud.support_v2beta.types.Actor):
            Output only. The user who uploaded the
            attachment. Note, the name and email will be
            obfuscated if the attachment was uploaded by
            Google support.
        filename (str):
            The filename of the attachment (e.g. ``"graph.jpg"``).
        mime_type (str):
            Output only. The MIME type of the attachment
            (e.g. text/plain).
        size_bytes (int):
            Output only. The size of the attachment in
            bytes.
