class Action(proto.Message):
    r"""Specifies a single action that runs a Docker container.

    Attributes:
        container_name (str):
            An optional name for the container. The
            container hostname will be set to this name,
            making it useful for inter-container
            communication. The name must contain only upper
            and lowercase alphanumeric characters and
            hyphens and cannot start with a hyphen.
        image_uri (str):
            Required. The URI to pull the container image from. Note
            that all images referenced by actions in the pipeline are
            pulled before the first action runs. If multiple actions
            reference the same image, it is only pulled once, ensuring
            that the same image is used for all actions in a single
            pipeline.

            The image URI can be either a complete host and image
            specification (e.g., quay.io/biocontainers/samtools), a
            library and image name (e.g., google/cloud-sdk) or a bare
            image name ('bash') to pull from the default library. No
            schema is required in any of these cases.

            If the specified image is not public, the service account
            specified for the Virtual Machine must have access to pull
            the images from GCR, or appropriate credentials must be
            specified in the
            [google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Action.credentials][google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Action.credentials]
            field.
        commands (MutableSequence[str]):
            If specified, overrides the ``CMD`` specified in the
            container. If the container also has an ``ENTRYPOINT`` the
            values are used as entrypoint arguments. Otherwise, they are
            used as a command and arguments to run inside the container.
        entrypoint (str):
            If specified, overrides the ``ENTRYPOINT`` specified in the
            container.
        environment (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The environment to pass into the container. This environment
            is merged with values specified in the
            [google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Pipeline][google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Pipeline]
            message, overwriting any duplicate values.

            In addition to the values passed here, a few other values
            are automatically injected into the environment. These
            cannot be hidden or overwritten.

            ``GOOGLE_PIPELINE_FAILED`` will be set to "1" if the
            pipeline failed because an action has exited with a non-zero
            status (and did not have the ``IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS`` flag
            set). This can be used to determine if additional debug or
            logging actions should execute.

            ``GOOGLE_LAST_EXIT_STATUS`` will be set to the exit status
            of the last non-background action that executed. This can be
            used by workflow engine authors to determine whether an
            individual action has succeeded or failed.
        encrypted_environment (google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Secret):
            The encrypted environment to pass into the container. This
            environment is merged with values specified in the
            [google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Pipeline][google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Pipeline]
            message, overwriting any duplicate values.

            The secret must decrypt to a JSON-encoded dictionary where
            key-value pairs serve as environment variable names and
            their values. The decoded environment variables can
            overwrite the values specified by the ``environment`` field.
        pid_namespace (str):
            An optional identifier for a PID namespace to
            run the action inside. Multiple actions should
            use the same string to share a namespace.  If
            unspecified, a separate isolated namespace is
            used.
        port_mappings (MutableMapping[int, int]):
            A map of containers to host port mappings for this
            container. If the container already specifies exposed ports,
            use the ``PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS`` flag instead.

            The host port number must be less than 65536. If it is zero,
            an unused random port is assigned. To determine the
            resulting port number, consult the ``ContainerStartedEvent``
            in the operation metadata.
        mounts (MutableSequence[google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Mount]):
            A list of mounts to make available to the action.

            In addition to the values specified here, every action has a
            special virtual disk mounted under ``/google`` that contains
            log files and other operational components.

            .. raw:: html

                  <li><code>/google/logs</code> All logs written during the pipeline

                  <li><code>/google/logs/action/*/stdout</code> The complete contents of
                  each individual action's standard output.</li>
                  <li><code>/google/logs/action/*/stderr</code> The complete contents of
                  each individual action's standard error output.</li>
                </ul>
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels to associate with the action. This
            field is provided to assist workflow engine
            authors in identifying actions (for example, to
            indicate what sort of action they perform, such
            as localization or debugging). They are returned
            in the operation metadata, but are otherwise
            ignored.
        credentials (google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Secret):
            If the specified image is hosted on a private registry other
            than Google Container Registry, the credentials required to
            pull the image must be specified here as an encrypted
            secret.

            The secret must decrypt to a JSON-encoded dictionary
            containing both ``username`` and ``password`` keys.
        timeout (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The maximum amount of time to give the action to complete.
            If the action fails to complete before the timeout, it will
            be terminated and the exit status will be non-zero. The
            pipeline will continue or terminate based on the rules
            defined by the ``ALWAYS_RUN`` and ``IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS``
            flags.
        ignore_exit_status (bool):
            Normally, a non-zero exit status causes the
            pipeline to fail. This flag allows execution of
            other actions to continue instead.
        run_in_background (bool):
            This flag allows an action to continue
            running in the background while executing
            subsequent actions. This is useful to provide
            services to other actions (or to provide
            debugging support tools like SSH servers).
        always_run (bool):
            By default, after an action fails, no further
            actions are run. This flag indicates that this
            action must be run even if the pipeline has
            already failed. This is useful for actions that
            copy output files off of the VM or for
            debugging. Note that no actions will be run if
            image prefetching fails.
        enable_fuse (bool):
            Enable access to the FUSE device for this action.
            Filesystems can then be mounted into disks shared with other
            actions. The other actions do not need the ``enable_fuse``
            flag to access the mounted filesystem.

            This has the effect of causing the container to be executed
            with ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` and exposes ``/dev/fuse`` to the
            container, so use it only for containers you trust.
        publish_exposed_ports (bool):
            Exposes all ports specified by ``EXPOSE`` statements in the
            container. To discover the host side port numbers, consult
            the ``ACTION_STARTED`` event in the operation metadata.
        disable_image_prefetch (bool):
            All container images are typically downloaded
            before any actions are executed. This helps
            prevent typos in URIs or issues like lack of
            disk space from wasting large amounts of compute
            resources.
            If set, this flag prevents the worker from
            downloading the image until just before the
            action is executed.
        disable_standard_error_capture (bool):
            A small portion of the container's standard error stream is
            typically captured and returned inside the
            ``ContainerStoppedEvent``. Setting this flag disables this
            functionality.
        block_external_network (bool):
            Prevents the container from accessing the
            external network.

            Required. The machine type of the virtual machine to create.
            Must be the short name of a standard machine type (such as
            "n1-standard-1") or a custom machine type (such as
            "custom-1-4096", where "1" indicates the number of vCPUs and
            "4096" indicates the memory in MB). See `Creating an
            instance with a custom machine
            type <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type#create>`__
            for more specifications on creating a custom machine type.
        preemptible (bool):
            If true, allocate a preemptible VM.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional set of labels to apply to the VM and any attached
            disk resources. These labels must adhere to the `name and
            value
            restrictions <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources>`__
            on VM labels imposed by Compute Engine.

            Labels keys with the prefix 'google-' are reserved for use
            by Google.

            Labels applied at creation time to the VM. Applied on a
            best-effort basis to attached disk resources shortly after
            VM creation.
        disks (MutableSequence[google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Disk]):
            The list of disks to create and attach to the VM.

            Specify either the ``volumes[]`` field or the ``disks[]``
            field, but not both.
        network (google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Network):
            The VM network configuration.
        accelerators (MutableSequence[google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Accelerator]):
            The list of accelerators to attach to the VM.
        service_account (google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.ServiceAccount):
            The service account to install on the VM.
            This account does not need any permissions other
            than those required by the pipeline.
        boot_disk_size_gb (int):
            The size of the boot disk, in GB. The boot
            disk must be large enough to accommodate all of
            the Docker images from each action in the
            pipeline at the same time. If not specified, a
            small but reasonable default value is used.
        cpu_platform (str):
            The CPU platform to request. An instance
            based on a newer platform can be allocated, but
            never one with fewer capabilities. The value of
            this parameter must be a valid Compute Engine
            CPU platform name (such as "Intel Skylake").
            This parameter is only useful for carefully
            optimized work loads where the CPU platform has
            a significant impact.
            For more information about the effect of this
            parameter, see
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform.
        boot_image (str):
            The host operating system image to use.

            Currently, only Container-Optimized OS images can be used.

            The default value is
            ``projects/cos-cloud/global/images/family/cos-stable``,
            which selects the latest stable release of
            Container-Optimized OS.

            This option is provided to allow testing against the beta
            release of the operating system to ensure that the new
            version does not interact negatively with production
            pipelines.

            To test a pipeline against the beta release of
            Container-Optimized OS, use the value
            ``projects/cos-cloud/global/images/family/cos-beta``.
        nvidia_driver_version (str):
            The NVIDIA driver version to use when attaching an NVIDIA
            GPU accelerator. The version specified here must be
            compatible with the GPU libraries contained in the container
            being executed, and must be one of the drivers hosted in the
            ``nvidia-drivers-us-public`` bucket on Google Cloud Storage.
        enable_stackdriver_monitoring (bool):
            Whether Stackdriver monitoring should be
            enabled on the VM.
        docker_cache_images (MutableSequence[str]):
            The Compute Engine Disk Images to use as a Docker cache. The
            disks will be mounted into the Docker folder in a way that
            the images present in the cache will not need to be pulled.
            The digests of the cached images must match those of the
            tags used or the latest version will still be pulled. The
            root directory of the ext4 image must contain ``image`` and
            ``overlay2`` directories copied from the Docker directory of
            a VM where the desired Docker images have already been
            pulled. Any images pulled that are not cached will be stored
            on the first cache disk instead of the boot disk. Only a
            single image is supported.
        volumes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.lifesciences_v2beta.types.Volume]):
            The list of disks and other storage to create or attach to
            the VM.

            Specify either the ``volumes[]`` field or the ``disks[]``
            field, but not both.
        reservation (str):
            If specified, the VM will only be allocated
            inside the matching reservation. It will fail if
            the VM parameters don't match the reservation.
