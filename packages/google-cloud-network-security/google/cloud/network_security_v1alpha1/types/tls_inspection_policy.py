    pools in Certificate Authority Service and associated metadata.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. Name of the resource. Name is of the form
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/tlsInspectionPolicies/{tls_inspection_policy}
            tls_inspection_policy should match the
            pattern:(^\ `a-z <[a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9]>`__?$).
        description (str):
            Optional. Free-text description of the
            resource.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the resource
            was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the resource
            was updated.
        ca_pool (str):
            Required. A CA pool resource used to issue interception
            certificates. The CA pool string has a relative resource
            path following the form
            "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/caPools/{ca_pool}".
        trust_config (str):
            Optional. A TrustConfig resource used when making a
            connection to the TLS server. This is a relative resource
            path following the form
            "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/trustConfigs/{trust_config}".
            This is necessary to intercept TLS connections to servers
            with certificates signed by a private CA or self-signed
            certificates. Note that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor
            this field.
        exclude_public_ca_set (bool):
            Optional. If FALSE (the default), use our default set of
            public CAs in addition to any CAs specified in trust_config.
            These public CAs are currently based on the Mozilla Root
            Program and are subject to change over time. If TRUE, do not
            accept our default set of public CAs. Only CAs specified in
            trust_config will be accepted. This defaults to FALSE (use
            public CAs in addition to trust_config) for backwards
            compatibility, but trusting public root CAs is *not
            recommended* unless the traffic in question is outbound to
            public web servers. When possible, prefer setting this to
            "false" and explicitly specifying trusted CAs and
            certificates in a TrustConfig. Note that Secure Web Proxy
            does not yet honor this field.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_exclude_public_ca_set``.
        min_tls_version (google.cloud.network_security_v1alpha1.types.TlsInspectionPolicy.TlsVersion):
            Optional. Minimum TLS version that the
            firewall should use when negotiating connections
            with both clients and servers. If this is not
            set, then the default value is to allow the
            broadest set of clients and servers (TLS 1.0 or
            higher). Setting this to more restrictive values
            may improve security, but may also prevent the
            firewall from connecting to some clients or
            servers.
            Note that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor
            this field.
        tls_feature_profile (google.cloud.network_security_v1alpha1.types.TlsInspectionPolicy.Profile):
            Optional. The selected Profile. If this is not set, then the
            default value is to allow the broadest set of clients and
            servers ("PROFILE_COMPATIBLE"). Setting this to more
            restrictive values may improve security, but may also
            prevent the TLS inspection proxy from connecting to some
            clients or servers. Note that Secure Web Proxy does not yet
            honor this field.
        custom_tls_features (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. List of custom TLS cipher suites selected. This
            field is valid only if the selected tls_feature_profile is
            CUSTOM. The
            [compute.SslPoliciesService.ListAvailableFeatures][] method
            returns the set of features that can be specified in this
            list. Note that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor this
            field.
