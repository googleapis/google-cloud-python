        INFORMATIONAL (1):
            Suspicious events that do not pose an
            immediate threat, but that are reported to call
            attention to deeper problems that could possibly
            exist.
        LOW (2):
            Warning-level threats that have very little
            impact on an organization's infrastructure. They
            usually require local or physical system access
            and may often result in victim privacy issues
            and information leakage.
        MEDIUM (3):
            Minor threats in which impact is minimized,
            that do not compromise the target or exploits
            that require an attacker to reside on the same
            local network as the victim, affect only
            non-standard configurations or obscure
            applications, or provide very limited access.
        HIGH (4):
            Threats that have the ability to become
            critical but have mitigating factors; for
            example, they may be difficult to exploit, do
            not result in elevated privileges, or do not
            have a large victim pool.
        CRITICAL (5):
            Serious threats, such as those that affect
            default installations of widely deployed
            software, result in root compromise of servers,
            and the exploit code is widely available to
            attackers. The attacker usually does not need
            any special authentication credentials or
            knowledge about the individual victims and the
            target does not need to be manipulated into
            performing any special functions.
