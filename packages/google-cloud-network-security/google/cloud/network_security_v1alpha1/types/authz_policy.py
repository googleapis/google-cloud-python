            match occurs when at least one HTTP rule matches
            the request or when no HTTP rules are specified
            in the policy. At least one HTTP Rule is

            policy will be allowed.

            When the action is ``DENY``, only requests matching the
            policy will be denied.

            following order:

            1. If there is a ``CUSTOM`` policy that matches the request,
               the ``CUSTOM`` policy is evaluated using the custom
               authorization providers and the request is denied if the
               provider rejects the request.

            2. If there are any ``DENY`` policies that match the
               request, the request is denied.

            3. If there are no ``ALLOW`` policies for the resource or if
               any of the ``ALLOW`` policies match the request, the
               request is allowed.

            4. Else the request is denied by default if none of the
               configured AuthzPolicies with ``ALLOW`` action match the
               request.
        custom_provider (google.cloud.network_security_v1alpha1.types.AuthzPolicy.CustomProvider):
            Optional. Required if the action is ``CUSTOM``. Allows
            delegating authorization decisions to Cloud IAP or to
            Service Extensions. One of ``cloudIap`` or
            ``authzExtension`` must be specified.
