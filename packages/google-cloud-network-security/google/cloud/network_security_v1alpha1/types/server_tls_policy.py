class ServerTlsPolicy(proto.Message):
    r"""ServerTlsPolicy is a resource that specifies how a server should
    authenticate incoming requests. This resource itself does not affect
    configuration unless it is attached to a target HTTPS proxy or
    endpoint config selector resource.

    ServerTlsPolicy in the form accepted by Application Load Balancers
    can be attached only to TargetHttpsProxy with an ``EXTERNAL``,
    ``EXTERNAL_MANAGED`` or ``INTERNAL_MANAGED`` load balancing scheme.
    Traffic Director compatible ServerTlsPolicies can be attached to
    EndpointPolicy and TargetHttpsProxy with Traffic Director
    ``INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`` load balancing scheme.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. Name of the ServerTlsPolicy resource. It matches
            the pattern
            ``projects/*/locations/{location}/serverTlsPolicies/{server_tls_policy}``

            Set of label tags associated with the
            resource.
        allow_open (bool):
            This field applies only for Traffic Director policies. It is
            must be set to false for Application Load Balancer policies.

            Determines if server allows plaintext connections. If set to
            true, server allows plain text connections. By default, it
            is set to false. This setting is not exclusive of other
            encryption modes. For example, if ``allow_open`` and
            ``mtls_policy`` are set, server allows both plain text and
            mTLS connections. See documentation of other encryption
            modes to confirm compatibility.

            Consider using it if you wish to upgrade in place your
            deployment to TLS while having mixed TLS and non-TLS traffic
            reaching port :80.
        server_certificate (google.cloud.network_security_v1alpha1.types.CertificateProvider):
            Optional if policy is to be used with Traffic Director. For
            Application Load Balancers must be empty.

            Defines a mechanism to provision server identity (public and
            private keys). Cannot be combined with ``allow_open`` as a
            permissive mode that allows both plain text and TLS is not
            supported.

            This field is required if the policy is used with
            Application Load Balancers. This field can be empty for
            Traffic Director.

            Defines a mechanism to provision peer validation
            certificates for peer to peer authentication (Mutual TLS -
            mTLS). If not specified, client certificate will not be
            requested. The connection is treated as TLS and not mTLS. If
            ``allow_open`` and ``mtls_policy`` are set, server allows
            both plain text and mTLS connections.
