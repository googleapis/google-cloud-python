class DatastreamRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Datastream.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the DatastreamRestTransport.

        We recommend only using this `post_update_stream_with_metadata`
        interceptor in new development instead of the `post_update_stream` interceptor.
        When both interceptors are used, this `post_update_stream_with_metadata` interceptor runs after the
        `post_update_stream` interceptor. The (possibly modified) response returned by
        `post_update_stream` will be passed to
