class DeleteReleaseRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""The request structure for the DeleteRelease method.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The resource name of the resource
            within a service.
        etag (str):
            The etag known to the client for the expected state of the
            release. This is used with state-changing methods to prevent
            accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be
            acting in parallel on the same resource.

            An etag wildcard provide optimistic concurrency based on the
            expected existence of the release. The Any wildcard (``*``)
            requires that the resource must already exists, and the Not
            Any wildcard (``!*``) requires that it must not.
        validate_only (bool):
            If "validate_only" is set to true, the service will try to
            validate that this request would succeed, but will not
            actually make changes.
        request_id (str):
            An optional request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been
            completed. The server will guarantee that for at
            least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
