class ResolveServiceRequest(proto.Message):

    [LookupService.ResolveService][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1.LookupService.ResolveService].
    Looks up a service by its name, returns the service and its
    endpoints.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The name of the service to resolve.
        max_endpoints (int):
            Optional. The maximum number of endpoints to
            return. Defaults to 25. Maximum is 100. If a
            value less than one is specified, the Default is
            used. If a value greater than the Maximum is
            specified, the Maximum is used.
        endpoint_filter (str):
            Optional. The filter applied to the endpoints of the
            resolved service.

            General ``filter`` string syntax:
            ``<field> <operator> <value> (<logical connector>)``

            -  ``<field>`` can be ``name``, ``address``, ``port``, or
               ``annotations.<key>`` for map field
            -  ``<operator>`` can be ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``,
               ``!=``, ``=``, ``:``. Of which ``:`` means ``HAS``, and
               is roughly the same as ``=``
            -  ``<value>`` must be the same data type as field
            -  ``<logical connector>`` can be ``AND``, ``OR``, ``NOT``

            Examples of valid filters:

            -  ``annotations.owner`` returns endpoints that have a
               annotation with the key ``owner``, this is the same as
               ``annotations:owner``
            -  ``annotations.protocol=gRPC`` returns endpoints that have
               key/value ``protocol=gRPC``
            -  ``address=192.108.1.105`` returns endpoints that have
               this address
            -  ``port>8080`` returns endpoints that have port number
               larger than 8080
            -

            ``name>projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c``
            returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically
            later than the string, so "endpoint-e" is returned but
            "endpoint-a" is not \*
            ``name=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/ep-1``
            returns the endpoint that has an endpoint_id equal to
            ``ep-1``

            -  ``annotations.owner!=sd AND annotations.foo=bar`` returns
               endpoints that have ``owner`` in annotation key but value
               is not ``sd`` AND have key/value ``foo=bar``
            -  ``doesnotexist.foo=bar`` returns an empty list. Note that
               endpoint doesn't have a field called "doesnotexist".
               Since the filter does not match any endpoint, it returns
               no results

            For more information about filtering, see `API
            Filtering <https://aip.dev/160>`__.
