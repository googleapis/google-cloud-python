class Service(proto.Message):
    r"""An individual service. A service contains a name and optional
    metadata. A service must exist before
    [endpoints][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1beta1.Endpoint] can be
    added to it.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name for the service in the format
            ``projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*``.
        metadata (Sequence[google.cloud.servicedirectory_v1beta1.types.Service.MetadataEntry]):
            Optional. Metadata for the service. This data can be
            consumed by service clients.

            Restrictions:

            -  The entire metadata dictionary may contain up to 2000
               characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs. Metadata
               that goes beyond this limit are rejected
            -  Valid metadata keys have two segments: an optional prefix
               and name, separated by a slash (/). The name segment is
               required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and
               ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with
               dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics
               between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix
               must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated
               by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total,
               followed by a slash (/). Metadata that fails to meet
               these requirements are rejected
            -  The ``(*.)google.com/`` and ``(*.)googleapis.com/``
               prefixes are reserved for system metadata managed by
               Service Directory. If the user tries to write to these
               keyspaces, those entries are silently ignored by the
               system

            Note: This field is equivalent to the ``annotations`` field
            in the v1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to
            the same location in Service Directory.
        endpoints (Sequence[google.cloud.servicedirectory_v1beta1.types.Endpoint]):
            Output only. Endpoints associated with this service.
            Returned on
            [LookupService.ResolveService][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1beta1.LookupService.ResolveService].
            Control plane clients should use
            [RegistrationService.ListEndpoints][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1beta1.RegistrationService.ListEndpoints].
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the service
            was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the service
            was last updated. Note: endpoints being
            created/deleted/updated within the service are
            not considered service updates for the purpose
            of this timestamp.
