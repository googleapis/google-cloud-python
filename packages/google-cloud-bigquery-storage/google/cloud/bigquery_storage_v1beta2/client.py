        Reads rows from the table in the format prescribed by the read
        session. Each response contains one or more table rows, up to a
        maximum of 10 MiB per response; read requests which attempt to read
        individual rows larger than this will fail.

        Each request also returns a set of stream statistics reflecting the
        estimated total number of rows in the read stream. This number is
        computed based on the total table size and the number of active
        streams in the read session, and may change as other streams continue
        to read data.

        Args:
            name (str):
                Required. Name of the stream to start
                reading from, of the form
                `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/sessions/{session_id}/streams/{stream_id}`
            offset (Optional[int]):
                The starting offset from which to begin reading rows from
                in the stream. The offset requested must be less than the last
                row read from ReadRows. Requesting a larger offset is
                undefined.
            retry (Optional[google.api_core.retry.Retry]):  A retry object used
                to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not
                be retried.
            timeout (Optional[float]): The amount of time, in seconds, to wait
                for the request to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is
                specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
            metadata (Optional[Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]]): Additional metadata
                that is provided to the method.
            retry_delay_callback (Optional[Callable[[float], None]]):
                If the client receives a retryable error that asks the client to
                delay its next attempt and retry_delay_callback is not None,
                BigQueryReadClient will call retry_delay_callback with the delay
                duration (in seconds) before it starts sleeping until the next
                attempt.

        Returns:
            ~google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.reader.ReadRowsStream:

        Raises:

                    failed for any reason.
            google.api_core.exceptions.RetryError: If the request failed due
                    to a retryable error and retry attempts failed.
