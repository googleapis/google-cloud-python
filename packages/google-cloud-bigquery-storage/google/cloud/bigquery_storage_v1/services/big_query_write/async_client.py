                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``

        offset beyond the current end of the stream or
        ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` if user provides an ``offset`` that has
        already been written to. User can retry with adjusted offset
        within the same RPC connection. If ``offset`` is not specified,
        append happens at the end of the stream.

        The response contains an optional offset at which the append
        happened. No offset information will be returned for appends to
        a default stream.

        Responses are received in the same order in which requests are
        sent. There will be one response for each successful inserted
        request. Responses may optionally embed error information if the
        originating AppendRequest was not successfully processed.

        The specifics of when successfully appended data is made visible
        to the table are governed by the type of stream:

        -  For COMMITTED streams (which includes the default stream),
           data is visible immediately upon successful append.

        -  For BUFFERED streams, data is made visible via a subsequent
           ``FlushRows`` rpc which advances a cursor to a newer offset
           in the stream.

        -  For PENDING streams, data is not made visible until the
           stream itself is finalized (via the ``FinalizeWriteStream``
           rpc), and the stream is explicitly committed via the
           ``BatchCommitWriteStreams`` rpc.

                The request object AsyncIterator. Request message for ``AppendRows``.

                Because AppendRows is a bidirectional streaming RPC,
                certain parts of the AppendRowsRequest need only be
                specified for the first request before switching table
                destinations. You can also switch table destinations
                within the same connection for the default stream.

                The size of a single AppendRowsRequest must be less than
                10 MB in size. Requests larger than this return an
                error, typically ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``.

            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be

        Args:
            request (Optional[Union[google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.FlushRowsRequest, dict]]):
                The request object. Request message for ``FlushRows``.
            write_stream (:class:`str`):
                Required. The stream that is the
                target of the flush operation.

                This corresponds to the ``write_stream`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,
                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                be of type `bytes`.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.FlushRowsResponse:
                Respond message for FlushRows.
