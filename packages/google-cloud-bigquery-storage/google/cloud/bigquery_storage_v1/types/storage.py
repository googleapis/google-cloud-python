            be lower than the requested number, depending on the amount
            parallelism that is reasonable for the table. There is a

            This must be greater than or equal to

            of the client (e.g. a Spark cluster with
            N-workers would set this to a low multiple of N
            to ensure good cluster utilization).

            The system will make a best effort to provide at
            least this number of streams, but in some cases
            might provide less.

    Because AppendRows is a bidirectional streaming RPC, certain parts
    of the AppendRowsRequest need only be specified for the first
    request before switching table destinations. You can also switch
    table destinations within the same connection for the default
    stream.

    The size of a single AppendRowsRequest must be less than 10 MB in
    size. Requests larger than this return an error, typically
    ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        write_stream (str):
            Required. The write_stream identifies the append operation.
            It must be provided in the following scenarios:

            -  In the first request to an AppendRows connection.

            -  In all subsequent requests to an AppendRows connection,
               if you use the same connection to write to multiple
               tables or change the input schema for default streams.

            For explicitly created write streams, the format is:

            -  ``projects/{project}/datasets/{dataset}/tables/{table}/streams/{id}``

            For the special default stream, the format is:

            -  ``projects/{project}/datasets/{dataset}/tables/{table}/streams/_default``.

            An example of a possible sequence of requests with
            write_stream fields within a single connection:

            -  r1: {write_stream: stream_name_1}

            -  r2: {write_stream: /*omit*/}

            -  r3: {write_stream: /*omit*/}

            -  r4: {write_stream: stream_name_2}

            -  r5: {write_stream: stream_name_2}

            The destination changed in request_4, so the write_stream
            field must be populated in all subsequent requests in this
            stream.
        offset (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int64Value):
            If present, the write is only performed if the next append
            offset is same as the provided value. If not present, the
            write is performed at the current end of stream. Specifying
            a value for this field is not allowed when calling
            AppendRows for the '_default' stream.
        proto_rows (google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.AppendRowsRequest.ProtoData):
            Rows in proto format.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``rows``.
        trace_id (str):
            Id set by client to annotate its identity.
            Only initial request setting is respected.
        missing_value_interpretations (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.AppendRowsRequest.MissingValueInterpretation]):
            A map to indicate how to interpret missing value for some
            fields. Missing values are fields present in user schema but
            missing in rows. The key is the field name. The value is the
            interpretation of missing values for the field.

            For example, a map {'foo': NULL_VALUE, 'bar': DEFAULT_VALUE}
            means all missing values in field foo are interpreted as
            NULL, all missing values in field bar are interpreted as the
            default value of field bar in table schema.

            If a field is not in this map and has missing values, the
            missing values in this field are interpreted as NULL.

            This field only applies to the current request, it won't
            affect other requests on the connection.

            Currently, field name can only be top-level column name,
            can't be a struct field path like 'foo.bar'.
        default_missing_value_interpretation (google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.AppendRowsRequest.MissingValueInterpretation):
            Optional. Default missing value interpretation for all
            columns in the table. When a value is specified on an
            ``AppendRowsRequest``, it is applied to all requests on the
            connection from that point forward, until a subsequent
            ``AppendRowsRequest`` sets it to a different value.
            ``missing_value_interpretation`` can override
            ``default_missing_value_interpretation``. For example, if
            you want to write ``NULL`` instead of using default values
            for some columns, you can set
            ``default_missing_value_interpretation`` to
            ``DEFAULT_VALUE`` and at the same time, set

    Attributes:
        append_result (google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.AppendRowsResponse.AppendResult):
            Result if the append is successful.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``response``.
        error (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
            Error returned when problems were encountered. If present,
            it indicates rows were not accepted into the system. Users
            can retry or continue with other append requests within the
            same connection.

            Additional information about error signalling:

            ALREADY_EXISTS: Happens when an append specified an offset,
            and the backend already has received data at this offset.
            Typically encountered in retry scenarios, and can be
            ignored.

            OUT_OF_RANGE: Returned when the specified offset in the
            stream is beyond the current end of the stream.

            INVALID_ARGUMENT: Indicates a malformed request or data.

            ABORTED: Request processing is aborted because of prior
            failures. The request can be retried if previous failure is
            addressed.

            INTERNAL: Indicates server side error(s) that can be
            retried.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``response``.
        updated_schema (google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.TableSchema):
            If backend detects a schema update, pass it
            to user so that user can use it to input new
            type of message. It will be empty when no schema
            updates have occurred.
        row_errors (MutableSequence[google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.RowError]):
            If a request failed due to corrupted rows, no
            rows in the batch will be appended. The API will
            return row level error info, so that the caller
            can remove the bad rows and retry the request.
        write_stream (str):
            The target of the append operation. Matches the write_stream
            in the corresponding request.
