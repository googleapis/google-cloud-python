            an initial request and the request times out. If

            prevents clients from accidentally creating

            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server knows to ignore
            the request if it has already been completed.
            The server guarantees that for at least 60
            minutes after the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
