               character.
            -  Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels.

        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            User annotations. These attributes can only be set and used
            by the user, and not by Cloud Deploy. Annotations must meet
            the following constraints:

            -  Annotations are key/value pairs.
            -  Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional
               prefix and name, separated by a slash (``/``).
            -  The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or
               less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
               (``[a-z0-9A-Z]``) with dashes (``-``), underscores
               (``_``), dots (``.``), and alphanumerics between.

               a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by
               dots(\ ``.``), not longer than 253 characters in total,

               numeric characters, underscores, and dashes.
            -  All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
               characters are allowed.

               character.
            -  Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels.

            Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be <=

        selectors (MutableSequence[google.cloud.deploy_v1.types.DeployPolicyResourceSelector]):

            the policy applies. For example, if there are
            two selectors and the action being attempted
            matches one of them, the policy will apply to
            that action.

            The server guarantees that for at least 60

            an initial request and the request times out. If

            ID, the server can check if original operation

            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating

               characters are allowed.
            -  Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
               character.
            -  Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels.

            minutes after the first request.

            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation

            prevents clients from accidentally creating

            -  Annotations are key/value pairs.
            -  Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional
               prefix and name, separated by a slash (``/``).
            -  The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or
               less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
               (``[a-z0-9A-Z]``) with dashes (``-``), underscores
               (``_``), dots (``.``), and alphanumerics between.

               numeric characters, underscores, and dashes.
            -  All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
               characters are allowed.
            -  Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
               character.
            -  Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels.

            checksum is computed by the server based on the value of
            other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests
