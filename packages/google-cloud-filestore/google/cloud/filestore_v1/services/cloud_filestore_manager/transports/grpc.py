    """gRPC backend transport for CloudFilestoreManager.

    Configures and manages Filestore resources.

    Filestore Manager v1.

    The ``file.googleapis.com`` service implements the Filestore API and
    defines the following resource model for managing instances:

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:
       ``/projects/*``
    -  Each project has a collection of available locations, named:
       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of instances and backups, named:
       ``/instances/*`` and ``/backups/*`` respectively.
    -  As such, Filestore instances are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}``
       and backups are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/backup/{backup_id}``

    Note that location_id must be a Google Cloud ``zone`` for instances,
    but a Google Cloud ``region`` for backups; for example:

    -  ``projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-filestore``
    -  ``projects/12345/locations/us-central1/backups/my-backup``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
