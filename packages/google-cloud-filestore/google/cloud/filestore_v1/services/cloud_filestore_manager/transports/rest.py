class CloudFilestoreManagerRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for CloudFilestoreManager.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the CloudFilestoreManagerRestTransport.

    Configures and manages Filestore resources.

    Filestore Manager v1.

    The ``file.googleapis.com`` service implements the Filestore API and
    defines the following resource model for managing instances:

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:
       ``/projects/*``
    -  Each project has a collection of available locations, named:
       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of instances and backups, named:
       ``/instances/*`` and ``/backups/*`` respectively.
    -  As such, Filestore instances are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}``
       and backups are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/backup/{backup_id}``

    Note that location_id must be a Google Cloud ``zone`` for instances,
    but a Google Cloud ``region`` for backups; for example:

    -  ``projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-filestore``
    -  ``projects/12345/locations/us-central1/backups/my-backup``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1
