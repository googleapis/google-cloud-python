class OptimizeToursRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request to be given to a tour optimization solver which
    defines the shipment model to solve as well as optimization
    parameters.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. Target project and location to make a call.

            Format: ``projects/{project-id}/locations/{location-id}``.

            If no location is specified, a region will be chosen
            automatically.
        timeout (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            If this timeout is set, the server returns a
            response before the timeout period has elapsed
            or the server deadline for synchronous requests
            is reached, whichever is sooner.

            For asynchronous requests, the server will
            generate a solution (if possible) before the
            timeout has elapsed.
        model (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.ShipmentModel):
            Shipment model to solve.
        solving_mode (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.OptimizeToursRequest.SolvingMode):
            By default, the solving mode is ``DEFAULT_SOLVE`` (0).
        search_mode (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.OptimizeToursRequest.SearchMode):
            Search mode used to solve the request.
        injected_first_solution_routes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.ShipmentRoute]):
            Guide the optimization algorithm in finding a first solution
            that is similar to a previous solution.

            The model is constrained when the first solution is built.
            Any shipments not performed on a route are implicitly
            skipped in the first solution, but they may be performed in
            successive solutions.

            The solution must satisfy some basic validity assumptions:

            -  for all routes, ``vehicle_index`` must be in range and
               not be duplicated.
            -  for all visits, ``shipment_index`` and
               ``visit_request_index`` must be in range.
            -  a shipment may only be referenced on one route.
            -  the pickup of a pickup-delivery shipment must be
               performed before the delivery.
            -  no more than one pickup alternative or delivery
               alternative of a shipment may be performed.
            -  for all routes, times are increasing (i.e.,
               ``vehicle_start_time <= visits[0].start_time <= visits[1].start_time ... <= vehicle_end_time``).
            -  a shipment may only be performed on a vehicle that is
               allowed. A vehicle is allowed if
               [Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices]
               is empty or its ``vehicle_index`` is included in
               [Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.allowed_vehicle_indices].

            If the injected solution is not feasible, a validation error
            is not necessarily returned and an error indicating
            infeasibility may be returned instead.
        injected_solution_constraint (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.InjectedSolutionConstraint):
            Constrain the optimization algorithm to find
            a final solution that is similar to a previous
            solution. For example, this may be used to
            freeze portions of routes which have already
            been completed or which are to be completed but
            must not be modified.

            If the injected solution is not feasible, a
            validation error is not necessarily returned and
            an error indicating infeasibility may be
            returned instead.
        refresh_details_routes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.ShipmentRoute]):
            If non-empty, the given routes will be refreshed, without
            modifying their underlying sequence of visits or travel
            times: only other details will be updated. This does not
            solve the model.

            As of 2020/11, this only populates the polylines of
            non-empty routes and requires that ``populate_polylines`` is
            true.

            The ``route_polyline`` fields of the passed-in routes may be
            inconsistent with route ``transitions``.

            This field must not be used together with
            ``injected_first_solution_routes`` or
            ``injected_solution_constraint``.

            ``Shipment.ignore`` and ``Vehicle.ignore`` have no effect on
            the behavior. Polylines are still populated between all
            visits in all non-empty routes regardless of whether the
            related shipments or vehicles are ignored.
        interpret_injected_solutions_using_labels (bool):
            If true:

            -  uses
               [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label]
               instead of ``vehicle_index`` to match routes in an
               injected solution with vehicles in the request; reuses
               the mapping of original
               [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index]
               to new
               [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_index]
               to update
               [ConstraintRelaxation.vehicle_indices][google.cloud.optimization.v1.InjectedSolutionConstraint.ConstraintRelaxation.vehicle_indices]
               if non-empty, but the mapping must be unambiguous (i.e.,
               multiple ``ShipmentRoute``\ s must not share the same
               original ``vehicle_index``).
            -  uses
               [ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label]
               instead of ``shipment_index`` to match visits in an
               injected solution with shipments in the request;
            -  uses
               [SkippedShipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label]
               instead of
               [SkippedShipment.index][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.index]
               to match skipped shipments in the injected solution with
               request shipments.

            This interpretation applies to the
            ``injected_first_solution_routes``,
            ``injected_solution_constraint``, and
            ``refresh_details_routes`` fields. It can be used when
            shipment or vehicle indices in the request have changed
            since the solution was created, perhaps because shipments or
            vehicles have been removed from or added to the request.

            If true, labels in the following categories must appear at
            most once in their category:

            -  [Vehicle.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Vehicle.label]
               in the request;
            -  [Shipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.label]
               in the request;
            -  [ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.vehicle_label]
               in the injected solution;
            -  [SkippedShipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label]
               and
               [ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit.shipment_label]
               in the injected solution (except pickup/delivery visit
               pairs, whose ``shipment_label`` must appear twice).

            If a ``vehicle_label`` in the injected solution does not
            correspond to a request vehicle, the corresponding route is
            removed from the solution along with its visits. If a
            ``shipment_label`` in the injected solution does not
            correspond to a request shipment, the corresponding visit is
            removed from the solution. If a
            [SkippedShipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.SkippedShipment.label]
            in the injected solution does not correspond to a request
            shipment, the ``SkippedShipment`` is removed from the
            solution.

            Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected
            solution may have an effect on the implied constraints,
            which may lead to change in solution, validation errors, or
            infeasibility.

            NOTE: The caller must ensure that each
            [Vehicle.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Vehicle.label]
            (resp.
            [Shipment.label][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.label])
            uniquely identifies a vehicle (resp. shipment) entity used
            across the two relevant requests: the past request that
            produced the ``OptimizeToursResponse`` used in the injected
            solution and the current request that includes the injected
            solution. The uniqueness checks described above are not
            enough to guarantee this requirement.
        consider_road_traffic (bool):
            Consider traffic estimation in calculating ``ShipmentRoute``
            fields
            [Transition.travel_duration][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Transition.travel_duration],

        populate_polylines (bool):
            If true, polylines will be populated in response
            ``ShipmentRoute``\ s.
        populate_transition_polylines (bool):
            If true, polylines will be populated in response

            Note that in this case, the polylines will also be populated
            in the deprecated ``travel_steps``.
        allow_large_deadline_despite_interruption_risk (bool):
            If this is set, then the request can have a
            deadline (see https://grpc.io/blog/deadlines) of
            up to 60 minutes. Otherwise, the maximum
            deadline is only 30 minutes. Note that
            long-lived requests have a significantly larger
            (but still small) risk of interruption.
        use_geodesic_distances (bool):
            If true, travel distances will be computed using geodesic
            distances instead of Google Maps distances, and travel times
            will be computed using geodesic distances with a speed
            defined by ``geodesic_meters_per_second``.
        geodesic_meters_per_second (float):
            When ``use_geodesic_distances`` is true, this field must be
            set and defines the speed applied to compute travel times.
            Its value must be at least 1.0 meters/seconds.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_geodesic_meters_per_second``.
        max_validation_errors (int):
            Truncates the number of validation errors returned. These
            errors are typically attached to an INVALID_ARGUMENT error
            payload as a BadRequest error detail

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        shipments (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Shipment]):
            Set of shipments which must be performed in
            the model.
        vehicles (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Vehicle]):
            Set of vehicles which can be used to perform
            visits.
        max_active_vehicles (int):
            Constrains the maximum number of active
            vehicles. A vehicle is active if its route
            performs at least one shipment. This can be used
            to limit the number of routes in the case where
            there are fewer drivers than vehicles and that
            the fleet of vehicles is heterogeneous. The
            optimization will then select the best subset of
            vehicles to use. Must be strictly positive.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_active_vehicles``.
        global_start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Global start and end time of the model: no times outside of
            this range can be considered valid.

            The model's time span must be less than a year, i.e. the
            ``global_end_time`` and the ``global_start_time`` must be
            within 31536000 seconds of each other.

            When using ``cost_per_*hour`` fields, you might want to set
            this window to a smaller interval to increase performance
            (eg. if you model a single day, you should set the global
            time limits to that day). If unset, 00:00:00 UTC, January 1,
            1970 (i.e. seconds: 0, nanos: 0) is used as default.
        global_end_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            If unset, 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1971 (i.e.
            seconds: 31536000, nanos: 0) is used as default.
        global_duration_cost_per_hour (float):
            The "global duration" of the overall plan is the difference
            between the earliest effective start time and the latest
            effective end time of all vehicles. Users can assign a cost
            per hour to that quantity to try and optimize for earliest
            job completion, for example. This cost must be in the same
            unit as
            [Shipment.penalty_cost][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.penalty_cost].
        duration_distance_matrices (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.ShipmentModel.DurationDistanceMatrix]):
            Specifies duration and distance matrices used in the model.
            If this field is empty, Google Maps or geodesic distances
            will be used instead, depending on the value of the
            ``use_geodesic_distances`` field. If it is not empty,
            ``use_geodesic_distances`` cannot be true and neither
            ``duration_distance_matrix_src_tags`` nor
            ``duration_distance_matrix_dst_tags`` can be empty.

        costs_per_vehicle_indices (MutableSequence[int]):
            Indices of the vehicles to which ``costs_per_vehicle``
            applies. If non-empty, it must have the same number of
            elements as ``costs_per_vehicle``. A vehicle index may not

            If both relative and absolute limits are specified on the
            same shipment, the more constraining limit is used for each
            possible pickup/delivery pair. As of 2017/10, detours are
            only supported when travel durations do not depend on
            vehicles.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_pickup_to_delivery_relative_detour_limit``.
        pickup_to_delivery_absolute_detour_limit (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Specifies the maximum absolute detour time compared to the
            shortest path from pickup to delivery. If specified, it must
            be nonnegative, and the shipment must contain at least a
            pickup and a delivery.

            For example, let t be the shortest time taken to go from the
            selected pickup alternative directly to the selected
            delivery alternative. Then setting
            ``pickup_to_delivery_absolute_detour_limit`` enforces:

        pickup_to_delivery_time_limit (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Specifies the maximum duration from start of
            pickup to start of delivery of a shipment. If
            specified, it must be nonnegative, and the
            shipment must contain at least a pickup and a
            delivery. This does not depend on which
            alternatives are selected for pickup and
            delivery, nor on vehicle speed. This can be
            specified alongside maximum detour constraints:
            the solution will respect both specifications.
        shipment_type (str):
            Non-empty string specifying a "type" for this shipment. This
            feature can be used to define incompatibilities or
            requirements between ``shipment_types`` (see
            ``shipment_type_incompatibilities`` and
            ``shipment_type_requirements`` in ``ShipmentModel``).

            Differs from ``visit_types`` which is specified for a single
            visit: All pickup/deliveries belonging to the same shipment
            share the same ``shipment_type``.
        label (str):
            Specifies a label for this shipment. This label is reported
            in the response in the ``shipment_label`` of the
            corresponding
            [ShipmentRoute.Visit][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Visit].
        ignore (bool):
            If true, skip this shipment, but don't apply a
            ``penalty_cost``.

            Ignoring a shipment results in a validation error when there
            are any ``shipment_type_requirements`` in the model.

            Ignoring a shipment that is performed in
            ``injected_first_solution_routes`` or
            ``injected_solution_constraint`` is permitted; the solver
            removes the related pickup/delivery visits from the
            performing route. ``precedence_rules`` that reference
            ignored shipments will also be ignored.

            cost (float):
                Cost to service this visit request on a vehicle route. This
                can be used to pay different costs for each alternative
                pickup or delivery of a shipment. This cost must be in the

        start_location (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            Geographic location where the vehicle starts before picking
            up any shipments. If not specified, the vehicle starts at
            its first pickup. If the shipment model has duration and
            distance matrices, ``start_location`` must not be specified.
        start_waypoint (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Waypoint):
            Waypoint representing a geographic location where the

            specified.
        start_tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            Specifies tags attached to the start of the
            vehicle's route.
            Empty or duplicate strings are not allowed.
        end_tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            Specifies tags attached to the end of the

            Empty or duplicate strings are not allowed.
        start_time_windows (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.TimeWindow]):
            Time windows during which the vehicle may depart its start
            location. They must be within the global time limits (see
            [ShipmentModel.global_*][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentModel.global_start_time]
            fields). If unspecified, there is no limitation besides
            those global time limits.

            Time windows belonging to the same repeated field must be
            disjoint, i.e. no time window can overlap with or be
            adjacent to another, and they must be in chronological
            order.

            ``cost_per_hour_after_soft_end_time`` and ``soft_end_time``
            can only be set if there is a single time window.
        end_time_windows (MutableSequence[google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.TimeWindow]):
            Time windows during which the vehicle may arrive at its end
            location. They must be within the global time limits (see
            [ShipmentModel.global_*][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentModel.global_start_time]
            fields). If unspecified, there is no limitation besides

            ``cost_per_hour_after_soft_end_time`` and ``soft_end_time``
            can only be set if there is a single time window.
        travel_duration_multiple (float):
            Specifies a multiplicative factor that can be used to
            increase or decrease travel times of this vehicle. For
            example, setting this to 2.0 means that this vehicle is
            slower and has travel times that are twice what they are for
            standard vehicles. This multiple does not affect visit
            durations. It does affect cost if ``cost_per_hour`` or
            ``cost_per_traveled_hour`` are specified. This must be in
            the range [0.001, 1000.0]. If unset, the vehicle is
            standard, and this multiple is considered 1.0.

            WARNING: Travel times will be rounded to the nearest second
            after this multiple is applied but before performing any
            numerical operations, thus, a small multiple may result in a
            loss of precision.

            See also ``extra_visit_duration_for_visit_type`` below.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_travel_duration_multiple``.
        unloading_policy (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Vehicle.UnloadingPolicy):
            Unloading policy enforced on the vehicle.
        load_limits (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Vehicle.LoadLimit]):
            Capacities of the vehicle (weight, volume, # of pallets for
            example). The keys in the map are the identifiers of the
            type of load, consistent with the keys of the
            [Shipment.load_demands][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.load_demands]
            field. If a given key is absent from this map, the
            corresponding capacity is considered to be limitless.
        cost_per_hour (float):
            Vehicle costs: all costs add up and must be in the same unit
            as
            [Shipment.penalty_cost][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.penalty_cost].

            Cost per hour of the vehicle route. This cost is applied to
            the total time taken by the route, and includes travel time,
            waiting time, and visit time. Using ``cost_per_hour``
            instead of just ``cost_per_traveled_hour`` may result in
            additional latency.
        cost_per_traveled_hour (float):
            Cost per traveled hour of the vehicle route. This cost is
            applied only to travel time taken by the route (i.e., that
            reported in
            [ShipmentRoute.transitions][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.transitions]),
            and excludes waiting time and visit time.
        cost_per_kilometer (float):
            Cost per kilometer of the vehicle route. This cost is
            applied to the distance reported in the
            [ShipmentRoute.transitions][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.transitions]
            and does not apply to any distance implicitly traveled from
            the ``arrival_location`` to the ``departure_location`` of a
            single ``VisitRequest``.
        fixed_cost (float):
            Fixed cost applied if this vehicle is used to
            handle a shipment.
        used_if_route_is_empty (bool):
            This field only applies to vehicles when their route does
            not serve any shipments. It indicates if the vehicle should
            be considered as used or not in this case.

            If true, the vehicle goes from its start to its end location
            even if it doesn't serve any shipments, and time and
            distance costs resulting from its start --> end travel are
            taken into account.

            Otherwise, it doesn't travel from its start to its end
            location, and no ``break_rule`` or delay (from
            ``TransitionAttributes``) are scheduled for this vehicle. In
            this case, the vehicle's ``ShipmentRoute`` doesn't contain
            any information except for the vehicle index and label.
        route_duration_limit (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Vehicle.DurationLimit):
            Limit applied to the total duration of the vehicle's route.
            In a given ``OptimizeToursResponse``, the route duration of
            a vehicle is the difference between its ``vehicle_end_time``
            and ``vehicle_start_time``.
        travel_duration_limit (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.Vehicle.DurationLimit):
            Limit applied to the travel duration of the vehicle's route.
            In a given ``OptimizeToursResponse``, the route travel
            duration is the sum of all its
            [transitions.travel_duration][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Transition.travel_duration].
        route_distance_limit (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.DistanceLimit):
            Limit applied to the total distance of the vehicle's route.
            In a given ``OptimizeToursResponse``, the route distance is
            the sum of all its
            [transitions.travel_distance_meters][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute.Transition.travel_distance_meters].
        extra_visit_duration_for_visit_type (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration]):
            Specifies a map from visit_types strings to durations. The
            duration is time in addition to
            [VisitRequest.duration][google.cloud.optimization.v1.Shipment.VisitRequest.duration]
            to be taken at visits with the specified ``visit_types``.
            This extra visit duration adds cost if ``cost_per_hour`` is
            specified. Keys (i.e. ``visit_types``) cannot be empty
            strings.

            If a visit request has multiple types, a duration will be
            added for each type in the map.
        break_rule (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.BreakRule):
            Describes the break schedule to be enforced
            on this vehicle. If empty, no breaks will be
            scheduled for this vehicle.
        label (str):
            Specifies a label for this vehicle. This label is reported
            in the response as the ``vehicle_label`` of the
            corresponding
            [ShipmentRoute][google.cloud.optimization.v1.ShipmentRoute].
        ignore (bool):
            If true, ``used_if_route_is_empty`` must be false, and this
            vehicle will remain unused.

            If a shipment is performed by an ignored vehicle in
            ``injected_first_solution_routes``, it is skipped in the
            first solution but is free to be performed in the response.

            If a shipment is performed by an ignored vehicle in
            ``injected_solution_constraint`` and any related
            pickup/delivery is constrained to remain on the vehicle
            (i.e., not relaxed to level ``RELAX_ALL_AFTER_THRESHOLD``),
            it is skipped in the response. If a shipment has a non-empty
            ``allowed_vehicle_indices`` field and all of the allowed
            vehicles are ignored, it is skipped in the response.

        start     (arrival)   (departure)   start   end      start    end     end

    Note that we make a difference between:

    -  "punctual events", such as the vehicle start and end and each
       visit's start and end (aka arrival and departure). They happen at
       a given second.
    -  "time intervals", such as the visits themselves, and the
       transition between visits. Though time intervals can sometimes
       have zero duration, i.e. start and end at the same second, they
       often have a positive duration.

    Invariants:

    -  If there are n visits, there are n+1 transitions.
    -  A visit is always surrounded by a transition before it (same
       index) and a transition after it (index + 1).
    -  The vehicle start is always followed by transition #0.
    -  The vehicle end is always preceded by transition #n.

    Zooming in, here is what happens during a ``Transition`` and a
    ``Visit``:

    ::

          |  * TRAVEL: the vehicle moves from   |      PERFORM the visit:     |
          |    VISIT[i-1].departure_location to |                             |
          |    VISIT[i].arrival_location, which |  * Spend some time:         |
          |    takes a given travel duration    |    the "visit duration".    |
          |    and distance                     |                             |

          |  * BREAKS: the driver may have      |    some quantities from the |
          |    breaks (e.g. lunch break).       |    vehicle: the "demand".   |
          |                                     |                             |
          |  * WAIT: the driver/vehicle does    |                             |
          |    nothing. This can happen for     |                             |
          |    many reasons, for example when   |                             |
          |    the vehicle reaches the next     |                             |
          |    event's destination before the   |                             |
          |    start of its time window         |                             |
          |                                     |                             |
          |  * DELAY: *right before* the next   |                             |
          |    arrival. E.g. the vehicle and/or |                             |
          |    driver spends time unloading.    |                             |
          |                                     |                             |
       ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-->
          ^                                     ^                             ^
       V[i-1].end                           V[i].start                    V[i].end

    Lastly, here is how the TRAVEL, BREAKS, DELAY and WAIT can be
    arranged during a transition.

    -  They don't overlap.
    -  The DELAY is unique and *must* be a contiguous period of time
       right before the next visit (or vehicle end). Thus, it suffice to
       know the delay duration to know its start and end time.
    -  The BREAKS are contiguous, non-overlapping periods of time. The
       response specifies the start time and duration of each break.
    -  TRAVEL and WAIT are "preemptable": they can be interrupted
       several times during this transition. Clients can assume that
       travel happens "as soon as possible" and that "wait" fills the
       remaining time.

    A (complex) example:

            Arrival at next_visit will likely happen later than its

            time ``travel_duration(previous_visit, next_visit)`` due to
            traffic. Also, a break may be forced to overlap with a visit

            (i.e., has no visits and has ``used_if_route_is_empty`` set to false
            in the model).

            ``relaxations(i).level`` specifies the constraint relaxation level
            applied to a visit #j that satisfies:

            -  ``route.visits(j).start_time >= relaxations(i).threshold_time``
               AND
            -  ``j + 1 >= relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count``

            Similarly, the vehicle start is relaxed to ``relaxations(i).level``
            if it satisfies:

            -  ``vehicle_start_time >= relaxations(i).threshold_time`` AND
            -  ``relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count == 0`` and the vehicle end
               is relaxed to ``relaxations(i).level`` if it satisfies:
            -  ``vehicle_end_time >= relaxations(i).threshold_time`` AND
            -  ``route.visits_size() + 1 >= relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count``

            To apply a relaxation level if a visit meets the
            ``threshold_visit_count`` OR the ``threshold_time`` add two
            ``relaxations`` with the same ``level``: one with only
            ``threshold_visit_count`` set and the other with only
            ``threshold_time`` set. If a visit satisfies the conditions of
            multiple ``relaxations``, the most relaxed level applies. As a
            result, from the vehicle start through the route visits in order to
            the vehicle end, the relaxation level becomes more relaxed: i.e.,
            the relaxation level is non-decreasing as the route progresses.

            The timing and sequence of route visits that do not satisfy the
            threshold conditions of any ``relaxations`` are fully constrained
            and no visits may be inserted into these sequences. Also, if a
            vehicle start or end does not satisfy the conditions of any
            relaxation the time is fixed, unless the vehicle is empty.

            Attributes:
                level (google.cloud.optimization_v1.types.InjectedSolutionConstraint.ConstraintRelaxation.Relaxation.Level):
                    The constraint relaxation level that applies when the
                    conditions at or after ``threshold_time`` AND at least
                    ``threshold_visit_count`` are satisfied.
                threshold_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
                    The time at or after which the relaxation ``level`` may be
                    applied.
                threshold_visit_count (int):
                    The number of visits at or after which the relaxation
                    ``level`` may be applied. If ``threshold_visit_count`` is 0
                    (or unset), the ``level`` may be applied directly at the
                    vehicle start.

                    If it is ``route.visits_size() + 1``, the ``level`` may only
                    be applied to the vehicle end. If it is more than
                    ``route.visits_size() + 1``, ``level`` is not applied at all
                    for that route.

class OptimizeToursValidationError(proto.Message):
    r"""Describes an error encountered when validating an
    ``OptimizeToursRequest``.

    Attributes:
        code (int):
            A validation error is defined by the pair (``code``,
            ``display_name``) which are always present.

            Other fields (below) provide more context about the error.

            *MULTIPLE ERRORS*: When there are multiple errors, the
            validation process tries to output several of them. Much
            like a compiler, this is an imperfect process. Some
            validation errors will be "fatal", meaning that they stop
            the entire validation process. This is the case for
            ``display_name="UNSPECIFIED"`` errors, among others. Some
            may cause the validation process to skip other errors.

            *STABILITY*: ``code`` and ``display_name`` should be very
            stable. But new codes and display names may appear over
            time, which may cause a given (invalid) request to yield a
            different (``code``, ``display_name``) pair because the new
            error hid the old one (see "MULTIPLE ERRORS").

            An error context may involve 0, 1 (most of the time) or more
            fields. For example, referring to vehicle #4 and shipment
            #2's first pickup can be done as follows:

            ::

               fields { name: "vehicles" index: 4}
               fields { name: "shipments" index: 2 sub_field {name: "pickups" index: 0} }

            Note, however, that the cardinality of ``fields`` should not
            change for a given error code.
        error_message (str):
            Human-readable string describing the error. There is a 1:1
            mapping between ``code`` and ``error_message`` (when code !=
            "UNSPECIFIED").

            *STABILITY*: Not stable: the error message associated to a
            given ``code`` may change (hopefully to clarify it) over
            time. Please rely on the ``display_name`` and ``code``
            instead.
        offending_values (str):
            May contain the value(s) of the field(s).
            This is not always available. You should
            absolutely not rely on it and use it only for
            manual model debugging.
