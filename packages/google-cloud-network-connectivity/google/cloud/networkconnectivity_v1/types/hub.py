            Optional. In the case of an update to an existing hub, field
            mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten. The
            fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the
            resource, not the full request. A field is overwritten if it
            is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask, then
            all fields are overwritten.
        hub (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.Hub):
            Required. The state that the hub should be in
            after the update.
        request_id (str):
            Optional. A request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server knows to ignore
            the request if it has already been completed.
            The server guarantees that a request doesn't
            result in creation of duplicate commitments for
            at least 60 minutes.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check to see whether the
            original operation was received. If it was, the
            server ignores the second request. This behavior
            prevents clients from mistakenly creating
            duplicate commitments.

        update_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            Optional. In the case of an update to an existing group,
            field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten.
            The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the
            resource, not the full request. A field is overwritten if it
            is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask, then
            all fields are overwritten.
        group (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.Group):
            Required. The state that the group should be
            in after the update.
        request_id (str):
            Optional. A request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server knows to ignore
            the request if it has already been completed.
            The server guarantees that a request doesn't
            result in creation of duplicate commitments for
            at least 60 minutes.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check to see whether the
            original operation was received. If it was, the
            server ignores the second request. This behavior
            prevents clients from mistakenly creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID, with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
