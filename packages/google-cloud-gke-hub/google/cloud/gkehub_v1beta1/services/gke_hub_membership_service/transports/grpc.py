    """gRPC backend transport for GkeHubMembershipService.

    The GKE Hub MembershipService handles the registration of many
    Kubernetes clusters to Google Cloud, represented with the
    [Membership][google.cloud.gkehub.v1beta1.Membership] resource.

    GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions
    in https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones.

    **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to
    use one of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where
    possible when working with Membership resources.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
