            by the Hub API and updates will be ignored.

            empty string to delete the key from the map. It's not
            possible to update a key's value to the empty string. If you
            specify the update_mask to be a special path "*", fully

        request_id (str):
            Optional. A request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been
            completed. The server will guarantee that for at
            least 60 minutes after the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
