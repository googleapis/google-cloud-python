    Attributes:
        endpoint (google.cloud.gkehub_v1.types.MembershipEndpoint):
            Optional. Endpoint information to reach this
            member.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``type``.
        name (str):
            Output only. The full, unique name of this Membership
            resource in the format
            ``projects/*/locations/*/memberships/{membership_id}``, set
            during creation.

            ``membership_id`` must be a valid RFC 1123 compliant DNS
            label:

            1. At most 63 characters in length
            2. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
               ``-``
            3. It must start and end with an alphanumeric character

            Which can be expressed as the regex:
            ``[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?``, with a maximum length of
            63 characters.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Labels for this membership.
        description (str):
            Output only. Description of this membership, limited to 63
            characters. Must match the regex:
            ``[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.\ ]*``

            This field is present for legacy purposes.
        state (google.cloud.gkehub_v1.types.MembershipState):
            Output only. State of the Membership
            resource.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. When the Membership was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. When the Membership was last
            updated.
        delete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. When the Membership was deleted.
        external_id (str):
            Optional. An externally-generated and managed ID for this
            Membership. This ID may be modified after creation, but this
            is not recommended.

            The ID must match the regex:
            ``[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]*``

            If this Membership represents a Kubernetes cluster, this
            value should be set to the UID of the ``kube-system``
            namespace object.
        last_connection_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. For clusters using Connect, the
            timestamp of the most recent connection
            established with Google Cloud. This time is
            updated every several minutes, not continuously.
            For clusters that do not use GKE Connect, or
            that have never connected successfully, this
            field will be unset.
        unique_id (str):
            Output only. Google-generated UUID for this resource. This
            is unique across all Membership resources. If a Membership
            resource is deleted and another resource with the same name
            is created, it gets a different unique_id.
        authority (google.cloud.gkehub_v1.types.Authority):
            Optional. How to identify workloads from this
            Membership. See the documentation on Workload
            Identity for more details:

            OIDC discovery will be performed on this URI to validate
            tokens from the issuer.

            Clearing ``issuer`` disables Workload Identity. ``issuer``
            cannot be directly modified; it must be cleared (and
            Workload Identity disabled) before using a new issuer (and
            re-enabling Workload Identity).
        workload_identity_pool (str):
            Output only. The name of the workload identity pool in which
            ``issuer`` will be recognized.

            There is a single Workload Identity Pool per Hub that is
            shared between all Memberships that belong to that Hub. For
            a Hub hosted in {PROJECT_ID}, the workload pool format is
            ``{PROJECT_ID}.hub.id.goog``, although this is subject to
            change in newer versions of this API.
        identity_provider (str):
            Output only. An identity provider that reflects the
            ``issuer`` in the workload identity pool.
        oidc_jwks (bytes):
            Optional. OIDC verification keys for this Membership in JWKS
            format (RFC 7517).

            When this field is set, OIDC discovery will NOT be performed
            on ``issuer``, and instead OIDC tokens will be validated
            using this field.
