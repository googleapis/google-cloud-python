    provides an ``__aiter__`` method to iterate through its

    ``ListMembershipRBACRoleBindings`` requests and continue to iterate
    through the ``rbacrolebindings`` field on the
    corresponding responses.

    attributes are available on the pager. If multiple requests are made, only
    the most recent response is retained, and thus used for attribute lookup.
