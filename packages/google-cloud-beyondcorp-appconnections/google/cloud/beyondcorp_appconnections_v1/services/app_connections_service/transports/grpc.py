class AppConnectionsServiceGrpcTransport(AppConnectionsServiceTransport):
    """gRPC backend transport for AppConnectionsService.

    API Overview:

    The ``beyondcorp.googleapis.com`` service implements the Google
    Cloud BeyondCorp API.

    Data Model:

    The AppConnectionsService exposes the following resources:

    -  AppConnections, named as follows:
       ``projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/appConnections/{app_connection_id}``.

    The AppConnectionsService service provides methods to manage
    (create/read/update/delete) BeyondCorp AppConnections.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the

                This argument is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.

                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``
                is used to create the channel. If a Callable is given, it will be called
                with the same arguments as used in ``self.create_channel``.
            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create
                a mutual TLS channel with client SSL credentials from
                ``client_cert_source`` or application default SSL credentials.

                ``api_mtls_endpoint`` is None.
            ssl_channel_credentials (grpc.ChannelCredentials): SSL credentials
                for the grpc channel. It is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            client_cert_source_for_mtls (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]):
                A callback to provide client certificate bytes and private key bytes,

            quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.
