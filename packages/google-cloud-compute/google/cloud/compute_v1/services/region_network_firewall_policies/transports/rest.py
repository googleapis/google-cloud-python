class RegionNetworkFirewallPoliciesRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for RegionNetworkFirewallPolicies.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the RegionNetworkFirewallPoliciesRestTransport.

                ~.compute.Policy:
                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
                Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify a
                ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows
                access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to
                ``true``. A condition can add constraints based on
                attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.
                **JSON example:**
                ``{ "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }``
                **YAML example:**
                ``bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3``

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.

                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
                Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify a
                ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows
                access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to
                ``true``. A condition can add constraints based on
                attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.
