class UrlMapsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for UrlMaps.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the UrlMapsRestTransport.

                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``

                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
