class RegionHealthChecksRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for RegionHealthChecks.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the RegionHealthChecksRestTransport.

                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited

                balancing and for autohealing VMs in a managed instance
                group (MIG). **Load balancing** Health check
                requirements vary depending on the type of load
                balancer. For details about the type of health check
                supported for each load balancer and corresponding
                backend type, see Health checks overview: Load balancer
                guide. **Autohealing in MIGs** The health checks that
                you use for autohealing VMs in a MIG can be either
                regional or global. For more information, see Set up an
                application health check and autohealing. For more
