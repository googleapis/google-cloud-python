class InstanceGroupManagersRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for InstanceGroupManagers.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the InstanceGroupManagersRestTransport.

                    API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                    responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                    - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                    resource. - For regional operations, use the
                    ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                    use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                    information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                    Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                    retention period.

                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited

                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
