class HealthChecksRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for HealthChecks.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the HealthChecksRestTransport.

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.

                timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
                metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                    sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.
