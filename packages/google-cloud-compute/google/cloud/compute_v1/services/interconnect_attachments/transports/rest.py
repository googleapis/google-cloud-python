class InterconnectAttachmentsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for InterconnectAttachments.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the InterconnectAttachmentsRestTransport.

                \*
                `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionOperations>`__

                `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/zoneOperations>`__
                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.

                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.

                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
