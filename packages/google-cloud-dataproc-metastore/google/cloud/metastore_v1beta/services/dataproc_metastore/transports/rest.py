class DataprocMetastoreRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for DataprocMetastore.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the DataprocMetastoreRestTransport.

    """REST backend transport for DataprocMetastore.

    Configures and manages metastore services. Metastore services are
    fully managed, highly available, autoscaled, autohealing, OSS-native
    deployments of technical metadata management software. Each
    metastore service exposes a network endpoint through which metadata
    queries are served. Metadata queries can originate from a variety of
    sources, including Apache Hive, Apache Presto, and Apache Spark.

    The Dataproc Metastore API defines the following resource model:

    -  The service works with a collection of Google Cloud projects,
       named: ``/projects/*``

    -  Each project has a collection of available locations, named:
       ``/locations/*`` (a location must refer to a Google Cloud
       ``region``)

    -  Each location has a collection of services, named:
       ``/services/*``

    -  Dataproc Metastore services are resources with names of the form:

       ``/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/services/{service_id}``.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1
