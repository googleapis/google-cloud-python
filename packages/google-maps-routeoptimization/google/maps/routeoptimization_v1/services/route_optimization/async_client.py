                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and

                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

        A ``ShipmentModel`` model consists mainly of ``Shipment``\ s

        to transport the ``Shipment``\ s. The ``ShipmentRoute``\ s
        assign ``Shipment``\ s to ``Vehicle``\ s. More specifically,
        they assign a series of ``Visit``\ s to each vehicle, where a
        ``Visit`` corresponds to a ``VisitRequest``, which is a pickup
        or delivery for a ``Shipment``.

        The goal is to provide an assignment of ``ShipmentRoute``\ s to
        ``Vehicle``\ s that minimizes the total cost where cost has many
        components defined in the ``ShipmentModel``.
