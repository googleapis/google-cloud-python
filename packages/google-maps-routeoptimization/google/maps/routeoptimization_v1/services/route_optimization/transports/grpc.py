        If the LRO's ``done`` field is true, then all requests have been
        processed. Any successfully processed requests will have their
        results available in Cloud Storage. Any requests that failed
        will not have their results available in Cloud Storage. If the
        LRO's ``error`` field is set, then it contains the error from
        one of the failed requests.
