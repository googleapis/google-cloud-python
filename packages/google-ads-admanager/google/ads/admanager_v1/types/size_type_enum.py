        Values:
            SIZE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Default value. This value is unused.
            PIXEL (1):
                Dimension based size, an actual height and
                width in pixels.
            ASPECT_RATIO (2):
                Size is expressed as a ratio. For example,
                4:1 could be met by a 100 x 25 sized image.
            INTERSTITIAL (3):
                Out-of-page (Interstitial) size that is not
                related to the slot it is served. This must be
                used with 1x1 size.
            IGNORED (4):
                Size is ignored. This must be used with 1x1
                size.
            NATIVE (5):
                Native size, which is a function of the how
                the client renders the creative. This must be
                used with 1x1 size.
            FLUID (6):
                Fluid size. Automatically sizes the ad by
                filling the width of the enclosing column and
                adjusting the height as appropriate. This must
                be used with 1x1 size.
            AUDIO (7):
                Audio size. Used with audio ads. This must be
                used with 1x1 size.
