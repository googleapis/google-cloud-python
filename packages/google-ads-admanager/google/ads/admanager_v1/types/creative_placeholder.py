            Optional. The companions that the creative is expected to
            have. This attribute can only be set if the line item it
            belongs to has an
            [EnvironmentType][google.ads.admanager.v1.EnvironmentTypeEnum.EnvironmentType]
            of VIDEO_PLAYER or

            of CREATIVE_SET.
        expected_creative_count (int):
            Optional. Non-empty default. Expected number
            of creatives that will be uploaded corresponding
            to this creative placeholder.  This estimate is
            used to improve the accuracy of forecasting; for
            example, if label frequency capping limits the
            number of times a creative may be served. By
            default, the expected creative count is set to
            1.

            Optional. Set of labels applied directly to
            this CreativePlaceholder.
        amp_only (bool):
            Optional. Non-empty default. Indicates if the
            expected creative of this placeholder has an AMP
            only variant. This is used to improve the
            accuracy of forecasting and has no effect on
            serving. By default, the value is false.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_amp_only``.
        creative_targeting_display_name (str):
            Optional. The display name of the creative
            targeting that this CreativePlaceholder
            represents.
