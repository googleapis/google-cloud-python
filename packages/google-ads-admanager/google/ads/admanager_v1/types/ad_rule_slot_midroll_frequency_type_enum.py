        Values:
            AD_RULE_SLOT_MIDROLL_FREQUENCY_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Default value. This value is unused.
            EVERY_N_CUEPOINTS (1):
                MidrollFrequency is a cue point interval and
                is a single integer value, such as "5", which
                means "play a mid-roll every 5th cue point".
            EVERY_N_SECONDS (2):
                MidrollFrequency is a time interval and
                mentioned as a single numeric value in seconds.
                For example, "100" would mean "play a mid-roll
                every 100 seconds".
            FIXED_CUE_POINTS (3):
                Same as ``FIXED_TIME``, except the values represent the
                ordinal cue points ("1,3,5", for example).
            FIXED_TIME (4):
                MidrollFrequency is a comma-delimited list of
                points in time (in seconds) when an ad should
                play. For example, "100,300" would mean "play an
                ad at 100 seconds and 300 seconds".
            NONE (5):
                The ad rule slot is not a mid-roll and
                MidrollFrequency should be ignored.
            REVERSE_MIDROLL_INDEX (6):
                After all other frequency type is applied and
                the number of midrolls are settled, this slot
                setting will override the mid-roll defined by
                ReverseMidrollIndex.
