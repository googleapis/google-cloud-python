            items, this represents the minimum quantity,
            which is a lifetime impression volume goal for
            reporting purposes only. For STANDARD line
            items, this represent the contracted quantity,

            field is only meaningful if the following conditions are
            met:

              network.
            - One of the following is true (both cannot be true, these

              - The environmentType is VIDEO_PLAYER.
              - The roadblockingType is CREATIVE_SET. This field
                defaults to OPTIONAL if the conditions are met. In all

                meaningful.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_companion_delivery_option``.
        allow_overbook (bool):
            Input only. The flag indicates whether
            overbooking should be allowed when creating or

            on this line item will never trigger a
            ForecastError, which corresponds to an overbook
            warning in the UI. The default value is false.
            Note: this field won't persist on the line item
            itself, and the value will only affect the

            the current request.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_skip_inventory_check``.
        skip_cross_selling_rule_warning_checks (bool):
            Input only. True to skip checks for warnings
            from rules applied to line items targeting
            inventory shared by a distributor partner for
            cross selling when performing an action on this
            line item. The default is false. Note:

            this field won't persist on the line item
            itself, and the value will only affect the
            current request.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_skip_cross_selling_rule_warning_checks``.

            Output only. Indicates how well the line item
            has been performing. This will be empty if the
            delivery indicator information is not available
            due to one of the following reasons:

              - The line item is not delivering.
              - The line item has an unlimited goal or cap.
              - The line item has a percentage based goal or
              cap.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_delivery_indicator``.
        budget (google.type.money_pb2.Money):
            Output only. The amount of money allocated to
            the LineItem. This attribute is readonly and is

            inherited from the order that contains this line

        same_advertiser_exception_enabled (bool):
            Optional. If a line item has a series of
            competitive exclusions on it, it could be
            blocked from serving with line items from the
            same advertiser. Setting this to true will allow
            line items from the same advertiser to serve
            regardless of the other competitive exclusion
            labels being applied.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_same_advertiser_exception_enabled``.
        update_source (str):

              [expected_creative_count][google.ads.admanager.v1.CreativePlaceholder.expected_creative_count].
              For example a LineItem specifies 750x350, 400x200 but only
              a 750x350 was uploaded. Or LineItem specifies 750x350 with
              an expected count of 2, but only one was uploaded.
            - The [Creative.applied_labels][] of an associated Creative
              don't match the
              [CreativePlaceholder.applied_labels][google.ads.admanager.v1.CreativePlaceholder.applied_labels]
              of the LineItem. For example LineItem specifies 750x350
              with a Foo AppliedLabel but a 750x350 creative without a
              AppliedLabel was uploaded.
