                    Wednesday, but PREVIOUS_PERIOD will be Monday - Sunday.
                SAME_PERIOD_PREVIOUS_YEAR (24):

                    period starting 1 year prior to the date period provided in
                    date_range.

                    In the case where date_range is a FixedDateRange, this will
                    be a date range starting 1 year prior to the date_range
                    start date and ending 1 year prior to the date_range end
                    date.

                    In the case where date_range is a RelativeDateRange, this
                    will be a period of the same time frame exactly 1 year prior
                    to the date_range. In the case where the date_range does not
                    capture the full period because a report is run in the
                    middle of that period, this will still be the full period 1
                    year prior. For example, if date range is THIS_WEEK, but the
                    report is run on a Wednesday, THIS_WEEK will be Monday -
                    Wednesday, but SAME_PERIOD_PREVIOUS_YEAR will be Monday -
