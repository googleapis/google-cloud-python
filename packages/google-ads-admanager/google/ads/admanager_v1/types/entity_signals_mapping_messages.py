    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        audience_segment_id (int):
            ID of an AudienceSegment that this mapping
            belongs to.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``entity``.
        content_bundle_id (int):
            ID of a ContentBundle that this mapping
            belongs to.
