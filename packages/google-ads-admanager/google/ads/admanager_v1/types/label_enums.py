            AD_EXCLUSION (1):

                the label as an exclusion.
            AD_UNIT_FREQUENCY_CAP (2):
                Allows for the creation of limits on the
                frequency that a user sees a particular type of
                creative over a portion of the inventory.
            CANONICAL_CATEGORY (3):
                Allows for the creation of labels mapped to a
                Google canonical ad category, which can be used
                for competitive exclusions and blocking across
                Google systems.
            COMPETITIVE_EXCLUSION (4):
                Allows for the creation of labels to exclude
                competing ads from showing on the same page.
            CREATIVE_WRAPPER (5):
                Allows for the creation of labels that can be
                used to force the wrapping of a delivering
                creative with header/footer creatives.
