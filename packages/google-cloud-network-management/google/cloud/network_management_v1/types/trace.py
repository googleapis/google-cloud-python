            UNKNOWN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS (1):
                Destination external address cannot be
                resolved to a known target. If the address is
                used in a Google Cloud project, provide the
                project ID as test input.
            FOREIGN_IP_DISALLOWED (2):
                A Compute Engine instance can only send or receive a packet
                with a foreign IP address if ip_forward is enabled.
            FIREWALL_RULE (3):
                Dropped due to a firewall rule, unless
                allowed due to connection tracking.

                Dropped due to no matching routes.
            ROUTE_BLACKHOLE (5):
                Dropped due to invalid route. Route's next
                hop is a blackhole.

                Packet is sent to a wrong (unintended)
                network. Example: you trace a packet from
                VM1:Network1 to VM2:Network2, however, the route
                configured in Network1 sends the packet destined
                for VM2's IP address to Network3.

                Route's next hop IP address cannot be
                resolved to a GCP resource.

                Route's next hop forwarding rule doesn't
                match next hop IP address.
            ROUTE_NEXT_HOP_VPN_TUNNEL_NOT_ESTABLISHED (52):
                Route's next hop VPN tunnel is down (does not
                have valid IKE SAs).
            ROUTE_NEXT_HOP_FORWARDING_RULE_TYPE_INVALID (53):
                Route's next hop forwarding rule type is

            VPN_TUNNEL_REMOTE_SELECTOR_MISMATCH (46):
                The packet does not match a policy-based VPN
                tunnel remote selector.
            PRIVATE_TRAFFIC_TO_INTERNET (7):
                Packet with internal destination address sent

                Instance with only an internal IP address
                tries to access Google API and services, but

                configurations on a VM allow this connection.

                Destination internal address cannot be
                resolved to a known target. If this is a shared
                VPC scenario, verify if the service project ID
                is provided as test input. Otherwise, verify if
                the IP address is being used in the project.

            PSC_CONNECTION_NOT_ACCEPTED (26):
                The Private Service Connect endpoint is in a

                global access enabled.
            PSC_NEG_PRODUCER_FORWARDING_RULE_MULTIPLE_PORTS (54):
                The packet is sent to the Private Service

                this configuration is not supported.
            NO_NAT_SUBNETS_FOR_PSC_SERVICE_ATTACHMENT (57):
                No NAT subnets are defined for the PSC

            HYBRID_NEG_NON_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_MATCHED (55):
                The packet sent from the hybrid NEG proxy
                matches a non-dynamic route, but such a

            HYBRID_NEG_NON_LOCAL_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_MATCHED (56):
                The packet sent from the hybrid NEG proxy
