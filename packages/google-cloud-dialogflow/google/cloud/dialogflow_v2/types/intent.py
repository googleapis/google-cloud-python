class Intent(proto.Message):
    r"""An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation
    turn. For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined

    or says something, referred to as an end-user expression or end-user
    input, Dialogflow matches the end-user input to the best intent in

        webhook_state (google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.Intent.WebhookState):
            Optional. Indicates whether webhooks are
            enabled for the intent.
        priority (int):
            Optional. The priority of this intent. Higher numbers
            represent higher priorities.

            -  If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service
               translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the
               ``Normal`` priority in the console.
            -  If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored
               in runtime detect intent requests.
        is_fallback (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether this is a
            fallback intent.
        ml_disabled (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is disabled for
            the intent. Note: If ``ml_disabled`` setting is set to true,
            then this intent is not taken into account during inference
            in ``ML ONLY`` match mode. Also, auto-markup in the UI is
            turned off.
        live_agent_handoff (bool):
            Optional. Indicates that a live agent should be brought in
            to handle the interaction with the user. In most cases, when
            you set this flag to true, you would also want to set
            end_interaction to true as well. Default is false.
        end_interaction (bool):
            Optional. Indicates that this intent ends an
            interaction. Some integrations (e.g., Actions on
            Google or Dialogflow phone gateway) use this
            information to close interaction with an end
            user. Default is false.
        input_context_names (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The list of context names required for this intent
            to be triggered. Format:
            ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/sessions/-/contexts/<Context ID>``.
        events (MutableSequence[str]):

            contexts is not empty, all of the contexts must
            be present in the active user session for an
            event to trigger this intent. Event names are
            limited to 150 characters.
        training_phrases (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.Intent.TrainingPhrase]):
            Optional. The collection of examples that the

        action (str):
            Optional. The name of the action associated
            with the intent. Note: The action name must not
            contain whitespaces.
        output_contexts (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.Context]):
            Optional. The collection of contexts that are activated when
            the intent is matched. Context messages in this collection
            should not set the parameters field. Setting the
            ``lifespan_count`` to 0 will reset the context when the
            intent is matched. Format:
            ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/sessions/-/contexts/<Context ID>``.
        reset_contexts (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether to delete all
            contexts in the current session when this intent
            is matched.
        parameters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.Intent.Parameter]):
            Optional. The collection of parameters
            associated with the intent.
        messages (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.Intent.Message]):
            Optional. The collection of rich messages corresponding to
            the ``Response`` field in the Dialogflow console.

            Optional. The list of platforms for which the first

        root_followup_intent_name (str):
            Output only. Read-only. The unique identifier of the root
            intent in the chain of followup intents. It identifies the

            this field only in the output.

            Format: ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/intents/<Intent ID>``.
        parent_followup_intent_name (str):
            Read-only after creation. The unique identifier of the
            parent intent in the chain of followup intents. You can set
            this field when creating an intent, for example with
            [CreateIntent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Intents.CreateIntent]
            or
            [BatchUpdateIntents][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Intents.BatchUpdateIntents],

                Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part

                -  ``Part.text`` is set to a part of the phrase that has no

                intent or training, this counter is increased.
