    separate environments.

    When you edit an agent, you are editing the draft agent. At any
    point, you can save the draft agent as an agent version, which is an
    immutable snapshot of your agent.

    When you save the draft agent, it is published to the default
    environment. When you create agent versions, you can publish them to
    custom environments. You can create a variety of custom environments
    for:

    -  testing
    -  development
    -  production
    -  etc.

    For more information, see the `versions and environments
    guide <https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-versions>`__.
