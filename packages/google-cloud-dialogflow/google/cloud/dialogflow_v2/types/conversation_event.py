class ConversationEvent(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a notification sent to Pub/Sub subscribers for
    conversation lifecycle events.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        conversation (str):
            The unique identifier of the conversation this notification
            refers to. Format:
            ``projects/<Project ID>/conversations/<Conversation ID>``.
        type_ (google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.ConversationEvent.Type):
            The type of the event that this notification
            refers to.
        error_status (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
            More detailed information about an error. Only set for type
            UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR_IN_PHONE_CALL.
        new_message_payload (google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.Message):
            Payload of NEW_MESSAGE event.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload``.

            Payload of NEW_RECOGNITION_RESULT event.

        Values:
            TYPE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Type not set.
            CONVERSATION_STARTED (1):
                A new conversation has been opened. This is
                fired when a telephone call is answered, or a
                conversation is created via the API.
            CONVERSATION_FINISHED (2):
                An existing conversation has closed. This is
                fired when a telephone call is terminated, or a
                conversation is closed via the API.
            HUMAN_INTERVENTION_NEEDED (3):
                An existing conversation has received
                notification from Dialogflow that human
                intervention is required.
            NEW_MESSAGE (5):
                An existing conversation has received a new message, either
                from API or telephony. It is configured in
                [ConversationProfile.new_message_event_notification_config][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.ConversationProfile.new_message_event_notification_config]
            NEW_RECOGNITION_RESULT (7):
                An existing conversation has received a new speech
                recognition result. This is mainly for delivering
                intermediate transcripts. The notification is configured in
                [ConversationProfile.new_recognition_event_notification_config][].
            UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR (4):
                Unrecoverable error during a telephone call.

                In general non-recoverable errors only occur if something
                was misconfigured in the ConversationProfile corresponding
                to the call. After a non-recoverable error, Dialogflow may
                stop responding.

                We don't fire this event:

                -  in an API call because we can directly return the error,
                   or,
                -  when we can recover from an error.
