class AnswerRecord(proto.Message):
    r"""Answer records are records to manage answer history and feedbacks
    for Dialogflow.

    Currently, answer record includes:

    -  human agent assistant article suggestion
    -  human agent assistant faq article

    It doesn't include:

    -  ``DetectIntent`` intent matching
    -  ``DetectIntent`` knowledge

    Answer records are not related to the conversation history in the
    Dialogflow Console. A Record is generated even when the end-user
    disables conversation history in the console. Records are created
    when there's a human agent assistant suggestion generated.

    A typical workflow for customers provide feedback to an answer is:

    1. For human agent assistant, customers get suggestion via
       ListSuggestions API. Together with the answers,
       [AnswerRecord.name][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.AnswerRecord.name]
       are returned to the customers.
    2. The customer uses the
       [AnswerRecord.name][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.AnswerRecord.name]
       to call the [UpdateAnswerRecord][] method to send feedback about
       a specific answer that they believe is wrong.
