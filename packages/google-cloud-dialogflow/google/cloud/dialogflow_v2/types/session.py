            ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/sessions/<Session ID>``, or

            If ``Environment ID`` is not specified, we assume default
            'draft' environment (``Environment ID`` might be referred to
            as environment name at some places). If ``User ID`` is not
            specified, we are using "-". It's up to the API caller to
            choose an appropriate ``Session ID`` and ``User Id``. They
            can be a random number or some type of user and session
            identifiers (preferably hashed). The length of the

            -  MapValue value: If parameter's entity type is a composite

            limited to: ``name``, ``display_name``, ``end_interaction``
            and ``is_fallback``.
        intent_detection_confidence (float):
            The intent detection confidence. Values range from 0.0
            (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). This
            value is for informational purpose only and is only used to
            help match the best intent within the classification
            threshold. This value may change for the same end-user
            expression at any time due to a model retraining or change
            in implementation. If there are
            ``multiple knowledge_answers`` messages, this value is set

class StreamingDetectIntentRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""The top-level message sent by the client to the
    [StreamingDetectIntent][] method.

    Multiple request messages should be sent in order:

    1. The first message must contain
       [session][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.session],
       [query_input][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.query_input]
       plus optionally
       [query_params][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.query_params].
       If the client wants to receive an audio response, it should also
       contain
       [output_audio_config][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.output_audio_config].
       The message must not contain
       [input_audio][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.input_audio].

    2. If
       [query_input][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.query_input]
       was set to
       [query_input.audio_config][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.InputAudioConfig],
       all subsequent messages must contain
       [input_audio][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.input_audio]
       to continue with Speech recognition. If you decide to rather
       detect an intent from text input after you already started Speech
       recognition, please send a message with
       [query_input.text][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.QueryInput.text].

       However, note that:

       -  Dialogflow will bill you for the audio duration so far.
       -  Dialogflow discards all Speech recognition results in favor of
          the input text.
       -  Dialogflow will use the language code from the first message.

    After you sent all input, you must half-close or abort the request
    stream.

    Attributes:
        session (str):
            Required. The name of the session the query is sent to.
            Format of the session name:
            ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/sessions/<Session ID>``, or
            ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/environments/<Environment ID>/users/<User ID>/sessions/<Session ID>``.
            If ``Environment ID`` is not specified, we assume default
            'draft' environment. If ``User ID`` is not specified, we are
            using "-". It's up to the API caller to choose an
            appropriate ``Session ID`` and ``User Id``. They can be a
            random number or some type of user and session identifiers
            (preferably hashed). The length of the ``Session ID`` and
            ``User ID`` must not exceed 36 characters.

            For more information, see the `API interactions
            guide <https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/api-overview>`__.

            Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See
            `Versions and
            environments <https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions>`__.
        query_params (google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.QueryParameters):
            The parameters of this query.
        query_input (google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.QueryInput):
            Required. The input specification. It can be
            set to:

            1. an audio config which instructs the speech
                recognizer how to process the speech audio,

            2. a conversational query in the form of text,
                or

            3. an event that specifies which intent to
                trigger.
        single_utterance (bool):
            Please use
            [InputAudioConfig.single_utterance][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.InputAudioConfig.single_utterance]
            instead. If ``false`` (default), recognition does not cease
            until the client closes the stream. If ``true``, the
            recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input
            audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice
            has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent
            is received, the client should close the stream and start a
            new request with a new stream as needed. This setting is
            ignored when ``query_input`` is a piece of text or an event.
        output_audio_config (google.cloud.dialogflow_v2.types.OutputAudioConfig):
            Instructs the speech synthesizer how to
            generate the output audio. If this field is not
            set and agent-level speech synthesizer is not
            configured, no output audio is generated.
        output_audio_config_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            Mask for
            [output_audio_config][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.output_audio_config]
            indicating which settings in this request-level config
            should override speech synthesizer settings defined at
            agent-level.

            If unspecified or empty,
            [output_audio_config][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.StreamingDetectIntentRequest.output_audio_config]
            replaces the agent-level config in its entirety.
        input_audio (bytes):
            The input audio content to be recognized. Must be sent if
            ``query_input`` was set to a streaming input audio config.
            The complete audio over all streaming messages must not
            exceed 1 minute.
        enable_debugging_info (bool):

            will get populated.

    While end-user audio is being processed, Dialogflow sends a series
    of results. Each result may contain a ``transcript`` value. A
    transcript represents a portion of the utterance. While the
    recognizer is processing audio, transcript values may be interim
