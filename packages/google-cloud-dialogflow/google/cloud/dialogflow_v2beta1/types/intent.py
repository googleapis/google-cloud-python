class Intent(proto.Message):
    r"""An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation
    turn. For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined
    intents can handle a complete conversation. When an end-user writes
    or says something, referred to as an end-user expression or end-user
    input, Dialogflow matches the end-user input to the best intent in
    your agent. Matching an intent is also known as intent
    classification.

    Attributes:
        name (str):

        display_name (str):
            Required. The name of this intent.

        priority (int):
            Optional. The priority of this intent. Higher numbers
            represent higher priorities.

            -  If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service
               translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the
               ``Normal`` priority in the console.
            -  If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored
               in runtime detect intent requests.
        is_fallback (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether this is a
            fallback intent.
        ml_enabled (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is enabled for
            the intent. Note: If ``ml_enabled`` setting is set to false,
            then this intent is not taken into account during inference
            in ``ML ONLY`` match mode. Also, auto-markup in the UI is
            turned off. DEPRECATED! Please use ``ml_disabled`` field
            instead. NOTE: If both ``ml_enabled`` and ``ml_disabled``
            are either not set or false, then the default value is
            determined as follows:

            -  Before April 15th, 2018 the default is: ml_enabled =
               false / ml_disabled = true.
            -  After April 15th, 2018 the default is: ml_enabled = true
               / ml_disabled = false.
        ml_disabled (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is disabled for
            the intent. Note: If ``ml_disabled`` setting is set to true,
            then this intent is not taken into account during inference
            in ``ML ONLY`` match mode. Also, auto-markup in the UI is
            turned off.
        live_agent_handoff (bool):

            you set this flag to true, you would also want to set
            end_interaction to true as well. Default is false.
        end_interaction (bool):
            Optional. Indicates that this intent ends an
            interaction. Some integrations (e.g., Actions on
            Google or Dialogflow phone gateway) use this
            information to close interaction with an end
            user. Default is false.
        input_context_names (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The list of context names required for this intent
            to be triggered. Formats:

            -  ``projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agent/sessions/-/contexts/<Context ID>``
        events (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The collection of event names that
            trigger the intent. If the collection of input
            contexts is not empty, all of the contexts must
            be present in the active user session for an
            event to trigger this intent. Event names are
            limited to 150 characters.

            Optional. The collection of examples that the
            agent is trained on.
        action (str):
            Optional. The name of the action associated
            with the intent. Note: The action name must not
            contain whitespaces.
        output_contexts (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dialogflow_v2beta1.types.Context]):
            Optional. The collection of contexts that are activated when
            the intent is matched. Context messages in this collection
            should not set the parameters field. Setting the
            ``lifespan_count`` to 0 will reset the context when the
            intent is matched. Format:
            ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/sessions/-/contexts/<Context ID>``.
        reset_contexts (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether to delete all
            contexts in the current session when this intent
            is matched.

            Optional. The collection of parameters
            associated with the intent.

            PLATFORM_UNSPECIFIED (i.e. default platform).
        root_followup_intent_name (str):
            Output only. The unique identifier of the root intent in the
            chain of followup intents. It identifies the correct
            followup intents chain for this intent.

            Format: ``projects/<Project ID>/agent/intents/<Intent ID>``.
        parent_followup_intent_name (str):
            Optional. The unique identifier of the parent intent in the
            chain of followup intents. You can set this field when
            creating an intent, for example with
            [CreateIntent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1.Intents.CreateIntent]
            or
            [BatchUpdateIntents][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1.Intents.BatchUpdateIntents],
            in order to make this intent a followup intent.

            It identifies the parent followup intent. Format:

                Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part
                boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when
                the parts are concatenated.

                If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with

                -  ``Part.text`` is set to a part of the phrase that has no

                   ``user_defined`` fields are all set.

                Optional. Indicates how many times this

                developer adds an existing sample by editing an
                intent or training, this counter is increased.
