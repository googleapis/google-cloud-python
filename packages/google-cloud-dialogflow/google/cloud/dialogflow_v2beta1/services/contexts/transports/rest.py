class ContextsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Contexts.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the ContextsRestTransport.

                    Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language
                context. If a person says to you "they are orange", you
                need context in order to understand what "they" is
                referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
                end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided
                with context in order to correctly match an intent.

                Using contexts, you can control the flow of a
                conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent
                by setting input and output contexts, which are
                identified by string names. When an intent is matched,
                any configured output contexts for that intent become
                active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is
                more likely to match intents that are configured with
                input contexts that correspond to the currently active
                contexts.

                For more information about context, see the `Contexts
                guide <https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview>`__.

                    Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language
                context. If a person says to you "they are orange", you
                need context in order to understand what "they" is
                referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
                end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided
                with context in order to correctly match an intent.

                Using contexts, you can control the flow of a
                conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent
                by setting input and output contexts, which are
                identified by string names. When an intent is matched,
                any configured output contexts for that intent become
                active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is
                more likely to match intents that are configured with
                input contexts that correspond to the currently active
                contexts.

                For more information about context, see the `Contexts
                guide <https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview>`__.

                    Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language
                context. If a person says to you "they are orange", you
                need context in order to understand what "they" is
                referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
                end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided
                with context in order to correctly match an intent.

                Using contexts, you can control the flow of a
                conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent
                by setting input and output contexts, which are
                identified by string names. When an intent is matched,
                any configured output contexts for that intent become
                active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is
                more likely to match intents that are configured with
                input contexts that correspond to the currently active
                contexts.

                For more information about context, see the `Contexts
                guide <https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview>`__.
