class EnvironmentsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Environments.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the EnvironmentsRestTransport.

                When you edit an agent, you are editing the draft agent.
                At any point, you can save the draft agent as an agent
                version, which is an immutable snapshot of your agent.

                When you save the draft agent, it is published to the
                default environment. When you create agent versions, you
                can publish them to custom environments. You can create
                a variety of custom environments for:

                -  testing
                -  development
