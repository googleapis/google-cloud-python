            Base Metrics
            Represents the intrinsic characteristics of a
            vulnerability that are constant over time and
            across user environments. This metric reflects
            the context by which vulnerability exploitation
            is possible.
        attack_complexity (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.AttackComplexity):
            This metric describes the conditions beyond
            the attacker's control that must exist in order
            to exploit the vulnerability.
        privileges_required (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.PrivilegesRequired):
            This metric describes the level of privileges
            an attacker must possess before successfully
            exploiting the vulnerability.
        user_interaction (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.UserInteraction):
            This metric captures the requirement for a
            human user, other than the attacker, to
            participate in the successful compromise of the
            vulnerable component.
        scope (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.Scope):
            The Scope metric captures whether a
            vulnerability in one vulnerable component
            impacts resources in components beyond its
            security scope.
        confidentiality_impact (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.Impact):
            This metric measures the impact to the
            confidentiality of the information resources
            managed by a software component due to a
            successfully exploited vulnerability.
        integrity_impact (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.Impact):
            This metric measures the impact to integrity
            of a successfully exploited vulnerability.
        availability_impact (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Cvssv3.Impact):
            This metric measures the impact to the
