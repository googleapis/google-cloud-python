    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The relative resource name of this notification config. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
            Example:

        description (str):

            (max of 1024 characters).
        pubsub_topic (str):
            The Pub/Sub topic to send notifications to. Its format is
            "projects/[project_id]/topics/[topic]".
        service_account (str):
            Output only. The service account that needs
            "pubsub.topics.publish" permission to publish to
            the Pub/Sub topic.
        streaming_config (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.NotificationConfig.StreamingConfig):
            The config for triggering streaming-based
            notifications.

        Attributes:
            filter (str):
                Expression that defines the filter to apply across
                create/update events of assets or findings as specified by
                the event type. The expression is a list of zero or more
                restrictions combined via logical operators ``AND`` and
                ``OR``. Parentheses are supported, and ``OR`` has higher
                precedence than ``AND``.

                Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
                and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
                negation. The fields map to those defined in the
                corresponding resource.

                The supported operators are:

                -  ``=`` for all value types.
                -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
                -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

                The supported value types are:

                -  string literals in quotes.
                -  integer literals without quotes.
                -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.
