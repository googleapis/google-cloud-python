    The Asset is a Security Command Center resource that captures
    information about a single Google Cloud resource. All
    modifications to an Asset are only within the context of
    Security Command Center and don't affect the referenced Google
    Cloud resource.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The relative resource name of this asset. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
            Example:
            "organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}".
        security_center_properties (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1beta1.types.Asset.SecurityCenterProperties):
            Security Command Center managed properties.
            These properties are managed by Security Command
            Center and cannot be modified by the user.
        resource_properties (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Resource managed properties. These properties
            are managed and defined by the Google Cloud
            resource and cannot be modified by the user.
        security_marks (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1beta1.types.SecurityMarks):
            User specified security marks. These marks
            are entirely managed by the user and come from
            the SecurityMarks resource that belongs to the
            asset.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time at which the asset was created in
            Security Command Center.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time at which the asset was last updated,
            added, or deleted in Security Command Center.
