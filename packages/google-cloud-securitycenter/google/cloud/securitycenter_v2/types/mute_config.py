class MuteConfig(proto.Message):
    r"""A mute config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the
    configuration to mute create/update events of findings.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            This field will be ignored if provided on config creation.
            The following list shows some examples of the format:

            -  ``organizations/{organization}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
            -

            ``organizations/{organization}locations/{location}//muteConfigs/{mute_config}``

            -  ``folders/{folder}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
            -  ``folders/{folder}/locations/{location}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
            -  ``projects/{project}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
            -  ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
        description (str):
            A description of the mute config.
        filter (str):
            Required. An expression that defines the filter to apply
            across create/update events of findings. While creating a
            filter string, be mindful of the scope in which the mute
            configuration is being created. E.g., If a filter contains
            project = X but is created under the project = Y scope, it
            might not match any findings.

            The following field and operator combinations are supported:

            -  severity: ``=``, ``:``
            -  category: ``=``, ``:``

            -  resource.parent_name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.parent_display_name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.type: ``=``, ``:``
            -  finding_class: ``=``, ``:``
            -  indicator.ip_addresses: ``=``, ``:``
            -  indicator.domains: ``=``, ``:``
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the mute
            config was created. This field is set by the
            server and will be ignored if provided on config
            creation.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The most recent time at which
            the mute config was updated. This field is set
            by the server and will be ignored if provided on
            config creation or update.
        most_recent_editor (str):
            Output only. Email address of the user who
            last edited the mute config. This field is set
            by the server and will be ignored if provided on
            config creation or update.
        type_ (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.MuteConfig.MuteConfigType):
            Required. The type of the mute config, which
            determines what type of mute state the config
            affects. Immutable after creation.
