            A number between 0 (inclusive) and infinity

            remediate. The higher the score, the more
            important it is to remediate.
        latest_calculation_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The most recent time the attack exposure was
            updated on this finding.
        attack_exposure_result (str):
            The resource name of the attack path
            simulation result that contains the details
            regarding this attack exposure score. Example:

            Output only. What state this AttackExposure
            is in. This captures whether or not an attack
            exposure has been calculated or not.
        exposed_high_value_resources_count (int):
            The number of high value resources that are
            exposed as a result of this finding.
        exposed_medium_value_resources_count (int):
            The number of medium value resources that are
            exposed as a result of this finding.
        exposed_low_value_resources_count (int):
