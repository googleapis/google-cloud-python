               components than the formatted_address.
            -  The array does not necessarily include all the political
               entities that contain an address, apart from those
               included in the formatted_address. To retrieve all the
               political entities that contain a specific address, you
               should use reverse geocoding, passing the
               latitude/longitude of the address as a parameter to the
               request.
            -  The format of the response is not guaranteed to remain
               the same between requests. In particular, the number of
               address_components varies based on the address requested
               and can change over time for the same address. A
               component can change position in the array. The type of
               the component can change. A particular component may be
               missing in a later response.
