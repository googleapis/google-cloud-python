            Place details will be displayed with the

            code is unspecified or unrecognized, place
            details of any language may be returned, with a

            Current list of supported languages:

            https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport.
        region_code (str):
            The Unicode country/region code (CLDR) of the location where
            the request is coming from. This parameter is used to
            display the place details, like region-specific place name,
            if available. The parameter can affect results based on
            applicable law.

            For more information, see
            https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html.

            Note that 3-digit region codes are not currently supported.
        included_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            Included Place type (eg, "restaurant" or "gas_station") from
            https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types.

            Up to 50 types from `Table
            A <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a>`__
            may be specified.

            If there are any conflicting types, i.e. a type appears in
            both included_types and excluded_types, an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned.

            If a Place type is specified with multiple type
            restrictions, only places that satisfy all of the
            restrictions are returned. For example, if we have
            {included_types = ["restaurant"], excluded_primary_types =
            ["restaurant"]}, the returned places provide "restaurant"
            related services but do not operate primarily as

            If the client provides both included_types (e.g. restaurant)
            and excluded_types (e.g. cafe), then the response should
            include places that are restaurant but not cafe. The
            response includes places that match at least one of the
            included_types and none of the excluded_types.

            If there are any conflicting types, i.e. a type appears in
            both included_types and excluded_types, an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned.

            If a Place type is specified with multiple type
            restrictions, only places that satisfy all of the

            "gas_station") from
            https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types.
            A place can only have a single primary type from the
            supported types table associated with it.

            appears in both included_primary_types and
            excluded_primary_types, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.

            the photo media resource name.
        max_width_px (int):
            Optional. Specifies the maximum desired width, in pixels, of
            the image. If the image is smaller than the values
            specified, the original image will be returned. If the image
            is larger in either dimension, it will be scaled to match

            Required. The resource name of a place, in the
            ``places/{place_id}`` format.
        language_code (str):
            Optional. Place details will be displayed
            with the preferred language if available.

            https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport.
        region_code (str):
            Optional. The Unicode country/region code (CLDR) of the
            location where the request is coming from. This parameter is
            used to display the place details, like region-specific
            place name, if available. The parameter can affect results
            based on applicable law. For more information, see
            https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html.

            Note that 3-digit region codes are not currently supported.
        session_token (str):
            Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session
            for billing purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64
            string with at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise
            an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

            The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and
            concludes when they select a place and a call to Place
            Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have
            multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address
            Validation request. The credentials used for each request
            within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud
            Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is
            no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for
            each session. If the ``session_token`` parameter is omitted,
            or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as
            if no session token was provided (each request is billed
            separately).

            We recommend the following guidelines:

            -  Use session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls.
            -  Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version
               4 UUID is recommended.
            -  Ensure that the credentials used for all Place
               Autocomplete, Place Details, and Address Validation
               requests within a session belong to the same Cloud
               Console project.
            -  Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new
               session. Using the same token for more than one session
               will result in each request being billed individually.

            (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types),

            empty set will not restrict the results. If both
            ``location_restriction`` and ``included_region_codes`` are

            language used in ``input`` is different from
            ``language_code`` or if the returned Place does not have a
            translation from the local language to ``language_code``.
        region_code (str):
            Optional. The region code, specified as a CLDR two-character
            region code. This affects address formatting, result
            ranking, and may influence what results are returned. This
            does not restrict results to the specified region. To
            restrict results to a region, use
            ``region_code_restriction``.
        origin (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            Optional. The origin point from which to calculate geodesic
            distance to the destination (returned as
            ``distance_meters``). If this value is omitted, geodesic
            distance will not be returned.
        input_offset (int):
            Optional. A zero-based Unicode character offset of ``input``
            indicating the cursor position in ``input``. The cursor
            position may influence what predictions are returned.

            If empty, defaults to the length of ``input``.
        include_query_predictions (bool):
            Optional. If true, the response will include
            both Place and query predictions. Otherwise the
            response will only return Place predictions.
        session_token (str):
