    """gRPC backend transport for Places.

    Service definition for the Places API. Note: every request (except
    for Autocomplete requests) requires a field mask set outside of the
    request proto (``all/*``, is not assumed). The field mask can be set
    via the HTTP header ``X-Goog-FieldMask``. See:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/choose-fields

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                authorization credentials to attach to requests. These
                credentials identify the application to the service; if none
                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the
                credentials from the environment.
                This argument is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.

            channel (Optional[Union[grpc.Channel, Callable[..., grpc.Channel]]]):
                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``
                is used to create the channel. If a Callable is given, it will be called
                with the same arguments as used in ``self.create_channel``.
            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create
                a mutual TLS channel with client SSL credentials from

                ``api_mtls_endpoint`` is None.
            ssl_channel_credentials (grpc.ChannelCredentials): SSL credentials
                for the grpc channel. It is ignored if a ``channel`` instance is provided.
            client_cert_source_for_mtls (Optional[Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]):
                A callback to provide client certificate bytes and private key bytes,

                ignored if a ``channel`` instance or ``ssl_channel_credentials`` is provided.
            quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.
