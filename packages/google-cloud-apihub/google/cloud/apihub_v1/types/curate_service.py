            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}``
        filter (str):
            Optional. An expression that filters the list of curation
            resources.

            A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
            operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a
            string. The comparison operator must be one of: ``<``,
            ``>``, ``:`` or ``=``. Filters are case insensitive.

            The following fields in the ``curation resource`` are
            eligible for filtering:

            - ``create_time`` - The time at which the curation was
              created. The value should be in the
              (RFC3339)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339] format.
              Allowed comparison operators: ``>`` and ``<``.
            - ``display_name`` - The display name of the curation.
              Allowed comparison operators: ``=``.
            - ``state`` - The state of the curation. Allowed comparison
              operators: ``=``.

            Expressions are combined with either ``AND`` logic operator
            or ``OR`` logical operator but not both of them together
            i.e. only one of the ``AND`` or ``OR`` operator can be used
            throughout the filter string and both the operators cannot
            be used together. No other logical operators are supported.
            At most three filter fields are allowed in the filter string
            and if provided more than that then ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``
            error is returned by the API.

            Here are a few examples:

            - ``create_time < \"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z\" AND create_time > \"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z\"``
              - The curation resource was created before *2021-08-15
              14:50:00 UTC* and after *2021-08-10 12:00:00 UTC*.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. The maximum number of curation
            resources to return. The service may return
            fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most
            50 curations will be returned. The maximum value
            is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to
            1000.
        page_token (str):
            Optional. A page token, received from a previous
            ``ListCurations`` call. Provide this to retrieve the
            subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters (except page_size)
            provided to ``ListCurations`` must match the call that
            provided the page token.
