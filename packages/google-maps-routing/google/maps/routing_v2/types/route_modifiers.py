    Attributes:
        avoid_tolls (bool):
            When set to true, avoids toll roads where reasonable, giving
            preference to routes not containing toll roads. Applies only
            to the ``DRIVE`` and ``TWO_WHEELER``
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode].
        avoid_highways (bool):
            When set to true, avoids highways where reasonable, giving
            preference to routes not containing highways. Applies only
            to the ``DRIVE`` and ``TWO_WHEELER``
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode].
        avoid_ferries (bool):
            When set to true, avoids ferries where reasonable, giving
            preference to routes not containing ferries. Applies only to
            the ``DRIVE`` and\ ``TWO_WHEELER``
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode].
        avoid_indoor (bool):
            When set to true, avoids navigating indoors where
            reasonable, giving preference to routes not containing
            indoor navigation. Applies only to the ``WALK``
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode].
        vehicle_info (google.maps.routing_v2.types.VehicleInfo):
            Specifies the vehicle information.
        toll_passes (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.TollPass]):
            Encapsulates information about toll passes. If toll passes
            are provided, the API tries to return the pass price. If
            toll passes are not provided, the API treats the toll pass
            as unknown and tries to return the cash price. Applies only
            to the ``DRIVE`` and ``TWO_WHEELER``
