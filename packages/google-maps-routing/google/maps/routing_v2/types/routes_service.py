            Optional. A set of waypoints along the route
            (excluding terminal points), for either stopping
            at or passing by. Up to 25 intermediate
            waypoints are supported.
        travel_mode (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteTravelMode):
            Optional. Specifies the mode of
            transportation.
        routing_preference (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RoutingPreference):
            Optional. Specifies how to compute the route. The server
            attempts to use the selected routing preference to compute
            the route. If the routing preference results in an error or
            an extra long latency, then an error is returned. You can
            specify this option only when the ``travel_mode`` is
            ``DRIVE`` or ``TWO_WHEELER``, otherwise the request fails.
        polyline_quality (google.maps.routing_v2.types.PolylineQuality):

            for the polyline.
        departure_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. The departure time. If you don't set this value,
            then this value defaults to the time that you made the
            request. NOTE: You can only specify a ``departure_time`` in
            the past when
            [``RouteTravelMode``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode]
            is set to ``TRANSIT``. Transit trips are available for up to
            7 days in the past or 100 days in the future.
        arrival_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. The arrival time. NOTE: Can only be set when
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] is
            set to ``TRANSIT``. You can specify either
            ``departure_time`` or ``arrival_time``, but not both.
            Transit trips are available for up to 7 days in the past or
            100 days in the future.
        compute_alternative_routes (bool):
            Optional. Specifies whether to calculate
            alternate routes in addition to the route. No
            alternative routes are returned for requests
            that have intermediate waypoints.
        route_modifiers (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteModifiers):
            Optional. A set of conditions to satisfy that
            affect the way routes are calculated.
        language_code (str):
            Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as "en-US" or
            "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Unicode Locale
            Identifier <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier>`__.
            See `Language
            Support <https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport>`__
            for the list of supported languages. When you don't provide
            this value, the display language is inferred from the
            location of the route request.
        region_code (str):
            Optional. The region code, specified as a ccTLD ("top-level
            domain") two-character value. For more information see
            `Country code top-level
            domains <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains>`__.
        units (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Units):
            Optional. Specifies the units of measure for the display
            fields. These fields include the ``instruction`` field in
            [``NavigationInstruction``][google.maps.routing.v2.NavigationInstruction].
            The units of measure used for the route, leg, step distance,
            and duration are not affected by this value. If you don't
            provide this value, then the display units are inferred from
            the location of the first origin.
        optimize_waypoint_order (bool):
            Optional. If set to true, the service attempts to minimize
            the overall cost of the route by re-ordering the specified
            intermediate waypoints. The request fails if any of the
            intermediate waypoints is a ``via`` waypoint. Use
            ``ComputeRoutesResponse.Routes.optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index``
            to find the new ordering. If
            ``ComputeRoutesResponseroutes.optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index``
            is not requested in the ``X-Goog-FieldMask`` header, the
            request fails. If ``optimize_waypoint_order`` is set to
            false,
            ``ComputeRoutesResponse.optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index``
            will be empty.
        requested_reference_routes (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.ComputeRoutesRequest.ReferenceRoute]):
            Optional. Specifies what reference routes to calculate as
            part of the request in addition to the default route. A
            reference route is a route with a different route
            calculation objective than the default route. For example a
            ``FUEL_EFFICIENT`` reference route calculation takes into
            account various parameters that would generate an optimal
            fuel efficient route. When using this feature, look for
            [``route_labels``][google.maps.routing.v2.Route.route_labels]
            on the resulting routes.
        extra_computations (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.ComputeRoutesRequest.ExtraComputation]):
            Optional. A list of extra computations which
            may be used to complete the request. Note: These
            extra computations may return extra fields on
            the response. These extra fields must also be
            specified in the field mask to be returned in
            the response.
        traffic_model (google.maps.routing_v2.types.TrafficModel):
            Optional. Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating
            time in traffic. This setting affects the value returned in
            the duration field in the
            [``Route``][google.maps.routing.v2.Route] and
            [``RouteLeg``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteLeg] which
            contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical
            averages. ``TrafficModel`` is only available for requests
            that have set
            [``RoutingPreference``][google.maps.routing.v2.RoutingPreference]
            to ``TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL`` and
            [``RouteTravelMode``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode]
            to ``DRIVE``. Defaults to ``BEST_GUESS`` if traffic is
            requested and ``TrafficModel`` is not specified.
        transit_preferences (google.maps.routing_v2.types.TransitPreferences):
            Optional. Specifies preferences that influence the route
            returned for ``TRANSIT`` routes. NOTE: You can only specify
            a ``transit_preferences`` when
            [``RouteTravelMode``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode]
            is set to ``TRANSIT``.

                feature.

                For ``DRIVE`` requests, this feature prioritizes shorter
                distance over driving comfort. For example, it may prefer
                local roads instead of highways, take dirt roads, cut
                through parking lots, etc. This feature does not return any
                maneuvers that Google Maps knows to be illegal.

                For ``BICYCLE`` and ``TWO_WHEELER`` requests, this feature
                returns routes similar to those returned when you don't
                specify ``requested_reference_routes``.

                This feature is not compatible with any other travel modes,
                via intermediate waypoints, or ``optimize_waypoint_order``;

            is set to ``TRANSIT``.
        arrival_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. The arrival time. NOTE: Can only be set when
            [``RouteTravelMode``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode]
            is set to ``TRANSIT``. You can specify either
            ``departure_time`` or ``arrival_time``, but not both.
        language_code (str):
            Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as "en-US" or
            "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Unicode Locale
            Identifier <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier>`__.

            Support <https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport>`__
            for the list of supported languages. When you don't provide
            this value, the display language is inferred from the
            location of the first origin.
        region_code (str):
            Optional. The region code, specified as a ccTLD ("top-level
            domain") two-character value. For more information see
            `Country code top-level
            domains <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains>`__.
        units (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Units):

            the display fields.
        extra_computations (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.ExtraComputation]):
            Optional. A list of extra computations which
            may be used to complete the request. Note: These
            extra computations may return extra fields on
            the response. These extra fields must also be
            specified in the field mask to be returned in
            the response.
        traffic_model (google.maps.routing_v2.types.TrafficModel):
            Optional. Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating
            time in traffic. This setting affects the value returned in
            the duration field in the
            [RouteMatrixElement][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteMatrixElement]
            which contains the predicted time in traffic based on
            historical averages.
            [RoutingPreference][google.maps.routing.v2.RoutingPreference]
            to ``TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL`` and
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] to
            ``DRIVE``. Defaults to ``BEST_GUESS`` if traffic is
            requested and ``TrafficModel`` is not specified.
        transit_preferences (google.maps.routing_v2.types.TransitPreferences):
            Optional. Specifies preferences that influence the route
            returned for ``TRANSIT`` routes. NOTE: You can only specify
            a ``transit_preferences`` when
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] is
            set to ``TRANSIT``.
