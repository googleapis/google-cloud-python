        destination (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Waypoint):
            Required. Destination waypoint.
        intermediates (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.Waypoint]):
            Optional. A set of waypoints along the route
            (excluding terminal points), for either stopping
            at or passing by. Up to 25 intermediate
            waypoints are supported.
        travel_mode (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteTravelMode):
            Optional. Specifies the mode of
            transportation.
        routing_preference (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RoutingPreference):
            Optional. Specifies how to compute the route. The server
            attempts to use the selected routing preference to compute
            the route. If the routing preference results in an error or
            an extra long latency, then an error is returned. You can
            specify this option only when the ``travel_mode`` is
            ``DRIVE`` or ``TWO_WHEELER``, otherwise the request fails.
        polyline_quality (google.maps.routing_v2.types.PolylineQuality):
            Optional. Specifies your preference for the
            quality of the polyline.

            for the polyline.
        departure_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. The departure time. If you don't set this value,
            then this value defaults to the time that you made the
            request. NOTE: You can only specify a ``departure_time`` in
            the past when
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] is
            set to ``TRANSIT``.
        arrival_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] is
            set to ``TRANSIT``. You can specify either departure_time or
            arrival_time, but not both.
        compute_alternative_routes (bool):
            Optional. Specifies whether to calculate
            alternate routes in addition to the route. No
            alternative routes are returned for requests
            that have intermediate waypoints.
        route_modifiers (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteModifiers):
            Optional. A set of conditions to satisfy that
            affect the way routes are calculated.
        language_code (str):
            Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as "en-US" or
            "sr-Latn". For more information, see
            http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier.
            See `Language
            Support <https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport>`__
            for the list of supported languages. When you don't provide
            this value, the display language is inferred from the
            location of the route request.
        region_code (str):
            Optional. The region code, specified as a ccTLD ("top-level
            domain") two-character value. For more information see
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains
        units (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Units):
            Optional. Specifies the units of measure for the display
            fields. These fields include the ``instruction`` field in
            [NavigationInstruction][google.maps.routing.v2.NavigationInstruction].
            The units of measure used for the route, leg, step distance,
            and duration are not affected by this value. If you don't
            provide this value, then the display units are inferred from
            the location of the first origin.
        optimize_waypoint_order (bool):
            Optional. If set to true, the service attempts to minimize
            the overall cost of the route by re-ordering the specified
            intermediate waypoints. The request fails if any of the
            intermediate waypoints is a ``via`` waypoint. Use
            ``ComputeRoutesResponse.Routes.optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index``
            to find the new ordering. If
            ``ComputeRoutesResponseroutes.optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index``
            is not requested in the ``X-Goog-FieldMask`` header, the
            request fails. If ``optimize_waypoint_order`` is set to
            false,
            ``ComputeRoutesResponse.optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index``
            will be empty.
        requested_reference_routes (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.ComputeRoutesRequest.ReferenceRoute]):
            Optional. Specifies what reference routes to calculate as
            part of the request in addition to the default route. A
            reference route is a route with a different route
            calculation objective than the default route. For example a
            ``FUEL_EFFICIENT`` reference route calculation takes into
            account various parameters that would generate an optimal
            fuel efficient route.
        extra_computations (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.ComputeRoutesRequest.ExtraComputation]):
            Optional. A list of extra computations which
            may be used to complete the request. Note: These
            extra computations may return extra fields on
            the response. These extra fields must also be
            specified in the field mask to be returned in
            the response.
        traffic_model (google.maps.routing_v2.types.TrafficModel):
            Optional. Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating
            time in traffic. This setting affects the value returned in
            the duration field in the
            [Route][google.maps.routing.v2.Route] and
            [RouteLeg][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteLeg] which contains
            the predicted time in traffic based on historical averages.
            ``TrafficModel`` is only available for requests that have
            set
            [RoutingPreference][google.maps.routing.v2.RoutingPreference]
            to ``TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL`` and
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] to
            ``DRIVE``. Defaults to ``BEST_GUESS`` if traffic is
            requested and ``TrafficModel`` is not specified.
        transit_preferences (google.maps.routing_v2.types.TransitPreferences):
            Optional. Specifies preferences that influence the route
            returned for ``TRANSIT`` routes. NOTE: You can only specify
            a ``transit_preferences`` when
            [RouteTravelMode][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] is
            set to ``TRANSIT``.
