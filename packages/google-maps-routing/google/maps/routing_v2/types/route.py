class Route(proto.Message):
    r"""Contains a route, which consists of a series of connected
    road segments that join beginning, ending, and intermediate
    waypoints.

    Attributes:
        route_labels (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteLabel]):
            Labels for the ``Route`` that are useful to identify
            specific properties of the route to compare against others.
        legs (MutableSequence[google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteLeg]):
            A collection of legs (path segments between waypoints) that
            make up the route. Each leg corresponds to the trip between
            two non-\ ``via``
            [``Waypoints``][google.maps.routing.v2.Waypoint]. For
            example, a route with no intermediate waypoints has only one
            leg. A route that includes one non-\ ``via`` intermediate
            waypoint has two legs. A route that includes one ``via``
            intermediate waypoint has one leg. The order of the legs
            matches the order of waypoints from ``origin`` to
            ``intermediates`` to ``destination``.
        distance_meters (int):
            The travel distance of the route, in meters.
        duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The length of time needed to navigate the route. If you set
            the ``routing_preference`` to ``TRAFFIC_UNAWARE``, then this
            value is the same as ``static_duration``. If you set the
            ``routing_preference`` to either ``TRAFFIC_AWARE`` or
            ``TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL``, then this value is calculated
            taking traffic conditions into account.
        static_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The duration of travel through the route
            without taking traffic conditions into
            consideration.
        polyline (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Polyline):
            The overall route polyline. This polyline is the combined
            polyline of all ``legs``.
        description (str):
            A description of the route.
        warnings (MutableSequence[str]):
            An array of warnings to show when displaying
            the route.
        viewport (google.geo.type.types.Viewport):
            The viewport bounding box of the polyline.
        travel_advisory (google.maps.routing_v2.types.RouteTravelAdvisory):
            Additional information about the route.
        optimized_intermediate_waypoint_index (MutableSequence[int]):
            If you set
            [``optimize_waypoint_order``][google.maps.routing.v2.ComputeRoutesRequest.optimize_waypoint_order]
            to true, this field contains the optimized ordering of
            intermediate waypoints. Otherwise, this field is empty. For
            example, if you give an input of Origin: LA; Intermediate
            waypoints: Dallas, Bangor, Phoenix; Destination: New York;
            and the optimized intermediate waypoint order is Phoenix,
            Dallas, Bangor, then this field contains the values [2, 0,
            1]. The index starts with 0 for the first intermediate
            waypoint provided in the input.
        localized_values (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Route.RouteLocalizedValues):
            Text representations of properties of the ``Route``.
        route_token (str):
            An opaque token that can be passed to `Navigation
            SDK <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation>`__
            to reconstruct the route during navigation, and, in the
            event of rerouting, honor the original intention when the
            route was created. Treat this token as an opaque blob. Don't
            compare its value across requests as its value may change
            even if the service returns the exact same route.

            NOTE: ``Route.route_token`` is only available for requests
            that have set ``ComputeRoutesRequest.routing_preference`` to
            ``TRAFFIC_AWARE`` or ``TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL``.
            ``Route.route_token`` is not supported for requests that
            have Via waypoints.
        polyline_details (google.maps.routing_v2.types.PolylineDetails):
            Contains information about details along the
            polyline.
