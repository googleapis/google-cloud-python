class TrafficModel(proto.Enum):
    r"""This field specifies one of the following assumptions to use when
    calculating travel time in traffic conditions, shown in the enums
    below. Depending on the enum chosen, the ``duration`` field of the
    TrafficModel response will vary. The value contains the predicted
    time to destination in traffic, based on historical averages.
    ``TrafficModel`` is only available for requests that have set
    [``RoutingPreference``][google.maps.routing.v2.RoutingPreference] to
    ``TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL`` and
    [``RouteTravelMode``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode] to
    ``DRIVE``.

    Values:
        TRAFFIC_MODEL_UNSPECIFIED (0):
            Unused. If specified, will default to ``BEST_GUESS``.
        BEST_GUESS (1):
            Indicates that the returned ``duration`` should be the best
            estimate of travel time given what is known about both
            historical traffic conditions and live traffic. Live traffic
            becomes more important the closer the ``departure_time`` is
            to now.
        PESSIMISTIC (2):
            Indicates that the returned duration should
            be longer than the actual travel time on most
            days, though occasional days with particularly
            bad traffic conditions may exceed this value.
        OPTIMISTIC (3):
            Indicates that the returned duration should
            be shorter than the actual travel time on most
            days, though occasional days with particularly
            good traffic conditions may be faster than this
            value.
