                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``

        HTTP/gRPC header ``X-Goog-FieldMask`` (see the `available URL

        The value is a comma separated list of field paths. See detailed
        documentation about `how to construct the field
        paths <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/field_mask.proto>`__.

        For example, in this method:

        -  Field mask of all available fields (for manual inspection):
           ``X-Goog-FieldMask: *``
        -  Field mask of Route-level duration, distance, and polyline
           (an example production setup):
           ``X-Goog-FieldMask: routes.duration,routes.distanceMeters,routes.polyline.encodedPolyline``

        Google discourage the use of the wildcard (``*``) response field
        mask, or specifying the field mask at the top level
        (``routes``), because:

        -  Selecting only the fields that you need helps our server save
           computation cycles, allowing us to return the result to you
           with a lower latency.
        -  Selecting only the fields that you need in your production
           job ensures stable latency performance. We might add more
           response fields in the future, and those new fields might
           require extra computation time. If you select all fields, or
           if you select all fields at the top level, then you might
           experience performance degradation because any new field we
           add will be automatically included in the response.
        -  Selecting only the fields that you need results in a smaller
           response size, and thus higher network throughput.

            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be

                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                be of type `bytes`.
