    r"""An Instance is a computing unit that an end customer can
    connect to. It's the main unit of computing resources in
    AlloyDB.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. The name of the instance resource with the
            format:

            -  projects/{project}/locations/{region}/clusters/{cluster_id}/instances/{instance_id}
               where the cluster and instance ID segments should satisfy
               the regex expression ``[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?``,
               e.g. 1-63 characters of lowercase letters, numbers, and
               dashes, starting with a letter, and ending with a letter
               or number. For more details see
               https://google.aip.dev/122. The prefix of the instance
               resource name is the name of the parent resource:
            -  projects/{project}/locations/{region}/clusters/{cluster_id}
        display_name (str):
            User-settable and human-readable display name
            for the Instance.
        uid (str):
            Output only. The system-generated UID of the
            resource. The UID is assigned when the resource
            is created, and it is retained until it is
            deleted.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Create time stamp
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Update time stamp
        delete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Delete time stamp
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels as key value pairs
        state (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.State):
            Output only. The current serving state of the
            instance.
        instance_type (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.InstanceType):
            Required. The type of the instance. Specified
            at creation time.
        machine_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.MachineConfig):
            Configurations for the machines that host the
            underlying database engine.
        availability_type (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.AvailabilityType):
            Availability type of an Instance. If empty, defaults to
            REGIONAL for primary instances. For read pools,
            availability_type is always UNSPECIFIED. Instances in the
            read pools are evenly distributed across available zones
            within the region (i.e. read pools with more than one node
            will have a node in at least two zones).
        gce_zone (str):
            The Compute Engine zone that the instance
            should serve from, per
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones
            This can ONLY be specified for ZONAL instances.
            If present for a REGIONAL instance, an error
            will be thrown. If this is absent for a ZONAL
            instance, instance is created in a random zone
            with available capacity.
        database_flags (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Database flags. Set at instance level.

            -  They are copied from primary instance on read instance
               creation.
            -  Read instances can set new or override existing flags
               that are relevant for reads, e.g. for enabling columnar
               cache on a read instance. Flags set on read instance may
               or may not be present on primary.

            This is a list of "key": "value" pairs. "key": The name of
            the flag. These flags are passed at instance setup time, so
            include both server options and system variables for
            Postgres. Flags are specified with underscores, not hyphens.
            "value": The value of the flag. Booleans are set to **on**
            for true and **off** for false. This field must be omitted
            if the flag doesn't take a value.
        writable_node (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.Node):
            Output only. This is set for the read-write
            VM of the PRIMARY instance only.
        nodes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.Node]):
            Output only. List of available read-only VMs
            in this instance, including the standby for a
            PRIMARY instance.

            Configuration for query insights.
        read_pool_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.ReadPoolConfig):
            Read pool instance configuration. This is required if the
            value of instanceType is READ_POOL.
        ip_address (str):
            Output only. The IP address for the Instance.
            This is the connection endpoint for an end-user
            application.
        public_ip_address (str):
            Output only. The public IP addresses for the Instance. This
            is available ONLY when enable_public_ip is set. This is the
            connection endpoint for an end-user application.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Reconciling
            (https://google.aip.dev/128#reconciliation). Set
            to true if the current state of Instance does
            not match the user's intended state, and the
            service is actively updating the resource to
            reconcile them. This can happen due to
            user-triggered updates or system actions like
            failover or maintenance.
        etag (str):
            For Resource freshness validation
            (https://google.aip.dev/154)
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Annotations to allow client tools to store
            small amount of arbitrary data. This is distinct
            from labels. https://google.aip.dev/128
        client_connection_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.ClientConnectionConfig):
            Optional. Client connection specific
            configurations
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        psc_instance_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.PscInstanceConfig):
            Optional. The configuration for Private
            Service Connect (PSC) for the instance.
        network_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Instance.InstanceNetworkConfig):
            Optional. Instance-level network
            configuration.
        outbound_public_ip_addresses (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. All outbound public IP addresses
