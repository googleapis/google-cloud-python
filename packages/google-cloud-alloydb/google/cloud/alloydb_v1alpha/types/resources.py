            User-settable and human-readable display name

        uid (str):
            Output only. The system-generated UID of the

            Availability type of an Instance. If empty, defaults to
            REGIONAL for primary instances. For read pools,
            availability_type is always UNSPECIFIED. Instances in the
            read pools are evenly distributed across available zones
            within the region (i.e. read pools with more than one node
            will have a node in at least two zones).

            This can ONLY be specified for ZONAL instances.
            If present for a REGIONAL instance, an error

            instance, instance is created in a random zone
            with available capacity.
        database_flags (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Database flags. Set at the instance level. They are copied
            from the primary instance on secondary instance creation.
            Flags that have restrictions default to the value at primary
            instance on read instances during creation. Read instances
            can set new flags or override existing flags that are
            relevant for reads, for example, for enabling columnar cache
            on a read instance. Flags set on read instance might or
            might not be present on the primary instance.

            This is a list of "key": "value" pairs. "key": The name of
            the flag. These flags are passed at instance setup time, so
            include both server options and system variables for
            Postgres. Flags are specified with underscores, not hyphens.
            "value": The value of the flag. Booleans are set to **on**
            for true and **off** for false. This field must be omitted
            if the flag doesn't take a value.
        writable_node (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.Node):
            Output only. This is set for the read-write
            VM of the PRIMARY instance only.
        nodes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.Node]):
            Output only. List of available read-only VMs
            in this instance, including the standby for a
            PRIMARY instance.
        query_insights_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.QueryInsightsInstanceConfig):
            Configuration for query insights.
        observability_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.ObservabilityInstanceConfig):
            Configuration for observability.
        read_pool_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.ReadPoolConfig):
            Read pool instance configuration. This is required if the
            value of instanceType is READ_POOL.
        ip_address (str):
            Output only. The IP address for the Instance.
            This is the connection endpoint for an end-user
            application.
        public_ip_address (str):
            Output only. The public IP addresses for the Instance. This
            is available ONLY when enable_public_ip is set. This is the
            connection endpoint for an end-user application.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Reconciling
            (https://google.aip.dev/128#reconciliation). Set
            to true if the current state of Instance does
            not match the user's intended state, and the
            service is actively updating the resource to
            reconcile them. This can happen due to
            user-triggered updates or system actions like
            failover or maintenance.
        etag (str):
            For Resource freshness validation
            (https://google.aip.dev/154)
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Annotations to allow client tools to store
            small amount of arbitrary data. This is distinct
            from labels. https://google.aip.dev/128
        update_policy (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.UpdatePolicy):
            Update policy that will be applied during
            instance update. This field is not persisted
            when you update the instance. To use a
            non-default update policy, you must

        client_connection_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.ClientConnectionConfig):

            configuration.
        gemini_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.GeminiInstanceConfig):
            Optional. Deprecated and unused. This field
            will be removed in the near future.
        outbound_public_ip_addresses (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. All outbound public IP addresses
            configured for the instance.
        activation_policy (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.ActivationPolicy):
            Optional. Specifies whether an instance needs to spin up.
            Once the instance is active, the activation policy can be
            updated to the ``NEVER`` to stop the instance. Likewise, the
            activation policy can be updated to ``ALWAYS`` to start the
            instance. There are restrictions around when an instance
            can/cannot be activated (for example, a read pool instance
            should be stopped before stopping primary etc.). Please
            refer to the API documentation for more details.
        connection_pool_config (google.cloud.alloydb_v1alpha.types.Instance.ConnectionPoolConfig):
