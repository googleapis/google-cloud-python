class GSuiteAddOnsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for GSuiteAddOns.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the GSuiteAddOnsRestTransport.

    A service for managing Google Workspace add-ons deployments.

    A Google Workspace add-on is a third-party embedded component
    that can be installed in Google Workspace Applications like
    Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides
    editors. Google Workspace add-ons can display UI cards, receive
    contextual information from the host application, and perform
    actions in the host application (See:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview for more
    information).

    A Google Workspace add-on deployment resource specifies metadata
    about the add-on, including a specification of the entry points
    in the host application that trigger add-on executions (see:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-manifests).
    Add-on deployments defined via the Google Workspace add-ons API
    define their entrypoints using HTTPS URLs (See:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes),

    A Google Workspace add-on deployment can be installed in
    developer mode, which allows an add-on developer to test the
    experience an end-user would see when installing and running the
    add-on in their G Suite applications.  When running in developer
    mode, more detailed error messages are exposed in the add-on UI
    to aid in debugging.

    A Google Workspace add-on deployment can be published to Google
    Workspace Marketplace, which allows other Google Workspace users
    to discover and install the add-on.  See:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-add-on-overview
    for details.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.
