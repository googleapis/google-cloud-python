class GSuiteAddOnsGrpcAsyncIOTransport(GSuiteAddOnsTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for GSuiteAddOns.

    A service for managing Google Workspace Add-ons deployments.

    A Google Workspace Add-on is a third-party embedded component
    that can be installed in Google Workspace Applications like
    Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides
    editors. Google Workspace Add-ons can display UI cards, receive
    contextual information from the host application, and perform
    actions in the host application (See:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview for more
    information).

    A Google Workspace Add-on deployment resource specifies metadata
    about the add-on, including a specification of the entry points
    in the host application that trigger add-on executions (see:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-manifests).
    Add-on deployments defined via the Google Workspace Add-ons API
    define their entrypoints using HTTPS URLs (See:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes),

    A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be installed in
    developer mode, which allows an add-on developer to test the
    experience an end-user would see when installing and running the
    add-on in their G Suite applications.  When running in developer
    mode, more detailed error messages are exposed in the add-on UI
    to aid in debugging.

    A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be published to Google
    Workspace Marketplace, which allows other Google Workspace users
    to discover and install the add-on.  See:

    https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-add-on-overview
    for details.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
