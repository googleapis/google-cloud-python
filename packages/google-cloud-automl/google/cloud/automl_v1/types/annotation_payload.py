    r"""Contains annotation information that is relevant to AutoML.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        translation (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.TranslationAnnotation):
            Annotation details for translation.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``detail``.
        classification (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.ClassificationAnnotation):
            Annotation details for content or image
            classification.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``detail``.
        image_object_detection (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.ImageObjectDetectionAnnotation):
            Annotation details for image object
            detection.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``detail``.
        text_extraction (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.TextExtractionAnnotation):
            Annotation details for text extraction.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``detail``.
        text_sentiment (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.TextSentimentAnnotation):
            Annotation details for text sentiment.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``detail``.
        annotation_spec_id (str):
            Output only . The resource ID of the
            annotation spec that this annotation pertains
            to. The annotation spec comes from either an
            ancestor dataset, or the dataset that was used
            to train the model in use.
        display_name (str):
            Output only. The value of
            [display_name][google.cloud.automl.v1.AnnotationSpec.display_name]
            when the model was trained. Because this field returns a
            value at model training time, for different models trained
            using the same dataset, the returned value could be
            different as model owner could update the ``display_name``
            between any two model training.
