            AnnotationSpec) when multiple are present on a
            single example.
            NOTE: Instance ID prediction quality is not a
            part of model evaluation and is done as best
            effort. Especially in cases when an entity goes
            off-screen for a longer time (minutes), when it
            comes back it may be given a new instance ID.

            Required. A time (frame) of a video to which
            this annotation pertains. Represented as the
            duration since the video's start.
        bounding_box (google.cloud.automl_v1beta1.types.BoundingPoly):

            for the video at the time_offset, value in [0, 1], higher
            means higher positivity confidence. For annotations created
            by the user the score is 1. When user approves an
            annotation, the original float score is kept (and not
            changed to 1).
