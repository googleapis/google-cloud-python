               produce bounding boxes which have at least this

            -  For Text Sentiment: ``sentiment_score`` - (float,
               deprecated) A value between -1 and 1, -1 maps to least
               positive sentiment, while 1 maps to the most positive one
               and the higher the score, the more positive the sentiment
               in the document is. Yet these values are relative to the
               training data, so e.g. if all data was positive then -1
               will be also positive (though the least). The
               sentiment_score shouldn't be confused with "score" or
               "magnitude" from the previous Natural Language Sentiment
               Analysis API.
