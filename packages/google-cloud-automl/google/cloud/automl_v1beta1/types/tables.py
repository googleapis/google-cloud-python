            Output only. The table_spec_id of the primary table of this
            dataset.
        target_column_spec_id (str):
            column_spec_id of the primary table's column that should be
            used as the training & prediction target. This column must
            be non-nullable and have one of following data types
            (otherwise model creation will error):

            -  CATEGORY

            -  FLOAT64

            If the type is CATEGORY , only up to 100 unique values may
            exist in that column across all rows.

            NOTE: Updates of this field will instantly affect any other
            users concurrently working with the dataset.
        weight_column_spec_id (str):
            column_spec_id of the primary table's column that should be
            used as the weight column, i.e. the higher the value the
            more important the row will be during model training.
            Required type: FLOAT64. Allowed values: 0 to 10000,
            inclusive on both ends; 0 means the row is ignored for
            training. If not set all rows are assumed to have equal
            weight of 1. NOTE: Updates of this field will instantly
            affect any other users concurrently working with the
            dataset.

            column_spec_id of the primary table column which specifies a
            possible ML use of the row, i.e. the column will be used to
            split the rows into TRAIN, VALIDATE and TEST sets. Required
            type: STRING. This column, if set, must either have all of
            ``TRAIN``, ``VALIDATE``, ``TEST`` among its values, or only
            have ``TEST``, ``UNASSIGNED`` values. In the latter case the
            rows with ``UNASSIGNED`` value will be assigned by AutoML.
            Note that if a given ml use distribution makes it impossible
            to create a "good" model, that call will error describing
            the issue. If both this column_spec_id and primary table's
            time_column_spec_id are not set, then all rows are treated

        optimization_objective (str):
            Objective function the model is optimizing towards. The

            the value of the objective function over the validation set.

            Required. The train budget of creating this
            model, expressed in milli node hours i.e. 1,000
            value in this field means 1 node hour.
            The training cost of the model will not exceed
            this budget. The final cost will be attempted to
            be close to the budget, though may end up being
            (even) noticeably smaller - at the backend's
            discretion. This especially may happen when
            further model training ceases to provide any
            improvements.
            If the budget is set to a value known to be
            insufficient to train a model for the given
            dataset, the training won't be attempted and
            will error.

            The train budget must be between 1,000 and
            72,000 milli node hours, inclusive.
        train_cost_milli_node_hours (int):
            Output only. The actual training cost of the
            model, expressed in milli node hours, i.e. 1,000
            value in this field means 1 node hour.
            Guaranteed to not exceed the train budget.
        disable_early_stopping (bool):
            Use the entire training budget. This disables
            the early stopping feature. By default, the
            early stopping feature is enabled, which means
            that AutoML Tables might stop training before
            the entire training budget has been used.
