            When paginating, all other parameters provided to

            Optional. The filter to apply to list the

            The filter syntax follows Google Cloud syntax:
            https://google.aip.dev/160.

            Supported fields for filtering:

            - ``name``: The resource name of the featured content.
            - ``content_metadata.description``: The description of the
              featured content.

            When a literal value is provided without a field, it will
            perform a substring search across both ``name`` and
            ``content_metadata.description``.

            Examples:

            - ``"test"``: Matches featured content where either the name
              or description contains "test" as a substring.
            - ``name="test"``: Matches featured content where the name
              contains "test".
            - ``content_metadata.description="test"``: Matches featured
              content where the description contains "test".
