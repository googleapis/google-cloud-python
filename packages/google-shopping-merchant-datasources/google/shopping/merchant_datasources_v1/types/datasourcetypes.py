            data source are **only** targeting local destinations.
            Legacy local products are prefixed with ``local~`` in the
            product resource ID. For example,
            ``accounts/123/products/local~en~US~sku123``.
        feed_label (str):
            Optional. Immutable. The feed label that is specified on the
            data source level.

            Must be less than or equal to 20 uppercase letters (A-Z),
            numbers (0-9), and dashes (-).

            See also `migration to feed
            labels <https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/products/feed-labels>`__.

            ``feedLabel`` and ``contentLanguage`` must be either both
            set or unset for data sources with product content type.
            They must be set for data sources with a file input.

            If set, the data source will only accept products matching
            this combination. If unset, the data source will accept
            products without that restriction.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_feed_label``.
        content_language (str):
            Optional. Immutable. The two-letter ISO 639-1 language of
            the items in the data source.

            ``feedLabel`` and ``contentLanguage`` must be either both
            set or unset. The fields can only be unset for data sources
            without file input.

            If set, the data source will only accept products matching
            this combination. If unset, the data source will accept
            products without that restriction.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_content_language``.
        countries (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The countries where the items may be displayed.
            Represented as a `CLDR territory
            code <https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/latest/common/main/en.xml>`__.
        default_rule (google.shopping.merchant_datasources_v1.types.PrimaryProductDataSource.DefaultRule):
            Optional. Default rule management of the data
            source. If set, the linked data sources will be
            replaced.
        contains_custom_rules (bool):
            Output only. The existing data source setup contains at
            least one custom (non-default) rule and therefore its
            management through the ``default_rule_data_sources`` field
            should be treated with caution.
        destinations (MutableSequence[google.shopping.merchant_datasources_v1.types.PrimaryProductDataSource.Destination]):
            Optional. A list of destinations describing
            where products of the data source can be shown.

            When retrieving the data source, the list
            contains all the destinations that can be used
            for the data source, including the ones that are
            disabled for the data source but enabled for the
            account.

            Only destinations that are enabled on the
            account, for example through program
            participation, can be enabled on the data
            source.

            If unset, during creation, the destinations will
            be inherited based on the account level program
            participation.

            If set, during creation or update, the data
            source will be set only for the specified
            destinations.

            Updating this field requires at least one
            destination.

                The list must not be empty.

                To link the data source to the default rule, you need to add
                a new reference to this list (in sequential order).

                To unlink the data source from the default rule, you need to
                remove the given reference from this list.

                Changing the order of this list will result in changing the
                priority of data sources in the default rule.

                For example, providing the following list: [``1001``,
                ``self``] will take attribute values from supplemental data
