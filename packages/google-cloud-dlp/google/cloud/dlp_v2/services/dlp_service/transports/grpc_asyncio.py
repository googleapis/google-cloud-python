    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for DlpService.

    The Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API is a service that
    allows clients to detect the presence of Personally Identifiable
    Information (PII) and other privacy-sensitive data in
    user-supplied, unstructured data streams, like text blocks or
    images.
    The service also includes methods for sensitive data redaction
    and scheduling of data scans on Google Cloud Platform based data
    sets.

    To learn more about concepts and find how-to guides see
    https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
