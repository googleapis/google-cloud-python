class Likelihood(proto.Enum):
    r"""Coarse-grained confidence level of how well a particular finding
    satisfies the criteria to match a particular infoType.

    Likelihood is calculated based on the number of signals a finding
    has that implies that the finding matches the infoType. For example,
    a string that has an '@' and a '.com' is more likely to be a match
    for an email address than a string that only has an '@'.

    In general, the highest likelihood level has the strongest signals
    that indicate a match. That is, a finding with a high likelihood has
    a low chance of being a false positive.

    works, see `Match

class CloudStorageRegexFileSet(proto.Message):
    r"""Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket.
    Regular expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over
    which files in the bucket to include.

    Included files are those that match at least one item in
    ``include_regex`` and do not match any items in ``exclude_regex``.
    Note that a file that matches items from both lists will *not* be
    included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e.,
    everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular
    expression.

    For example, given the input
    ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}``:

    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile`` will be included
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile`` will be included
       (``.*`` matches across ``/``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile`` will *not* be
       included (the full path doesn't match any items in
       ``include_regex``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile`` will *not* be included
       (the path matches an item in ``exclude_regex``)

    If ``include_regex`` is left empty, it will match all files by
    default (this is equivalent to setting ``include_regex: [".*"]``).

    Some other common use cases:

    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}`` will
       include all files in ``mybucket`` except for .pdf files
    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory/[^/]+"]}``
       will include all files directly under
       ``gs://mybucket/directory/``, without matching across ``/``

    Attributes:
        bucket_name (str):
            The name of a Cloud Storage bucket. Required.
        include_regex (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of regular expressions matching file paths to
            include. All files in the bucket that match at least one of

            files, except for those that also match an item in
            ``exclude_regex``. Leaving this field empty will match all
            files by default (this is equivalent to including ``.*`` in
            the list).

            number of rows scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0
            and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit.

                If this value is not specified and the table was modified
                between the given start and end times, the entire table will
                be scanned. If this value is specified, then rows are
                filtered based on the given start and end times. Rows with a
                ``NULL`` value in the provided BigQuery column are skipped.
                Valid data types of the provided BigQuery column are:
                ``INTEGER``, ``DATE``, ``TIMESTAMP``, and ``DATETIME``.

                If your BigQuery table is `partitioned at ingestion
                time <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables#ingestion_time>`__,

                pseudo-column names are case sensitive.

                -  ``_PARTITIONDATE``
                -  ``_PARTITION_LOAD_TIME``

                **For Datastore**

                If this value is specified, then entities are filtered based

                time the JobTrigger executed. This will be based on the time
                of the execution of the last run of the JobTrigger or the
                timespan end_time used in the last run of the JobTrigger.

                **For BigQuery**

                Inspect jobs triggered by automatic population will scan
                data that is at least three hours old when the job starts.
                This is because streaming buffer rows are not read during
                inspection and reading up to the current timestamp will
