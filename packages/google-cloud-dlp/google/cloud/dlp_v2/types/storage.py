    Included files are those that match at least one item in

    Note that a file that matches items from both lists will *not* be
    included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e.,
    everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular
    expression.

    For example, given the input
    ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}``:

    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile`` will be included

       ``include_regex``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile`` will *not* be included

    default (this is equivalent to setting ``include_regex: [".*"]``).

    Some other common use cases:

    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}`` will
       include all files in ``mybucket`` except for .pdf files
    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory/[^/]+"]}``
