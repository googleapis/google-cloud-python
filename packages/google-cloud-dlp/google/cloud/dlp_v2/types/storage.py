class Likelihood(proto.Enum):
    r"""Coarse-grained confidence level of how well a particular finding
    satisfies the criteria to match a particular infoType.

    Likelihood is calculated based on the number of signals a finding
    has that implies that the finding matches the infoType. For example,
    a string that has an '@' and a '.com' is more likely to be a match
    for an email address than a string that only has an '@'.

    In general, the highest likelihood level has the strongest signals
    that indicate a match. That is, a finding with a high likelihood has
    a low chance of being a false positive.

    works, see `Match

class CloudStorageRegexFileSet(proto.Message):
    r"""Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket.
    Regular expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over
    which files in the bucket to include.

    Included files are those that match at least one item in
    ``include_regex`` and do not match any items in ``exclude_regex``.
    Note that a file that matches items from both lists will *not* be
    included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e.,
    everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular
    expression.

    For example, given the input
    ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}``:

    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile`` will be included
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile`` will be included
       (``.*`` matches across ``/``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile`` will *not* be
       included (the full path doesn't match any items in
       ``include_regex``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile`` will *not* be included
       (the path matches an item in ``exclude_regex``)

    If ``include_regex`` is left empty, it will match all files by
    default (this is equivalent to setting ``include_regex: [".*"]``).

    Some other common use cases:

    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}`` will
       include all files in ``mybucket`` except for .pdf files
    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory/[^/]+"]}``
       will include all files directly under
       ``gs://mybucket/directory/``, without matching across ``/``

    Attributes:
        bucket_name (str):
            The name of a Cloud Storage bucket. Required.
        include_regex (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of regular expressions matching file paths to
            include. All files in the bucket that match at least one of

            files, except for those that also match an item in
            ``exclude_regex``. Leaving this field empty will match all
            files by default (this is equivalent to including ``.*`` in
            the list).

            if set to 0, all rows will be scanned. Only one of

            be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig.
        rows_limit_percent (int):
            Max percentage of rows to scan. The rest are omitted. The
            number of rows scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0
            and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit.

                be scanned. If this value is specified, then rows are
