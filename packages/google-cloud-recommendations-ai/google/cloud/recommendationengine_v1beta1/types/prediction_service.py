class PredictRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request message for Predict method.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. Full resource name of the format:
            ``{name=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/eventStores/default_event_store/placements/*}``
            The id of the recommendation engine placement. This id is
            used to identify the set of models that will be used to make
            the prediction.

            We currently support three placements with the following IDs
            by default:

            -  ``shopping_cart``: Predicts items frequently bought
               together with one or more catalog items in the same
               shopping session. Commonly displayed after
               ``add-to-cart`` events, on product detail pages, or on
               the shopping cart page.

            -  ``home_page``: Predicts the next product that a user will
               most likely engage with or purchase based on the shopping
               or viewing history of the specified ``userId`` or
               ``visitorId``. For example - Recommendations for you.

            -  ``product_detail``: Predicts the next product that a user
               will most likely engage with or purchase. The prediction
               is based on the shopping or viewing history of the
               specified ``userId`` or ``visitorId`` and its relevance
               to a specified ``CatalogItem``. Typically used on product
               detail pages. For example - More items like this.

            -  ``recently_viewed_default``: Returns up to 75 items
               recently viewed by the specified ``userId`` or
               ``visitorId``, most recent ones first. Returns nothing if
               neither of them has viewed any items yet. For example -
               Recently viewed.

            The full list of available placements can be seen at
            https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/datafeeds/default_catalog/dashboard
        user_event (google.cloud.recommendationengine_v1beta1.types.UserEvent):
            Required. Context about the user, what they
            are looking at and what action they took to
            trigger the predict request. Note that this user
            event detail won't be ingested to userEvent
            logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write request
            is required for event logging.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. Maximum number of results to return
            per page. Set this property to the number of
            prediction results required. If zero, the
            service will choose a reasonable default.
        page_token (str):
            Optional. The previous PredictResponse.next_page_token.
        filter (str):
            Optional. Filter for restricting prediction results. Accepts
            values for tags and the ``filterOutOfStockItems`` flag.

            -  Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to items that
               match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators ``OR``
               and ``NOT`` are supported if the expression is enclosed
               in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values
               by a space. ``-"tagA"`` is also supported and is
               equivalent to ``NOT "tagA"``. Tag values must be double
               quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1 KiB.

            -  filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to items
               that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK.

            Examples:

            -  tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT
               "promotional")
            -  filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-"promotional")
            -  filterOutOfStockItems
        dry_run (bool):
            Optional. Use dryRun mode for this prediction
            query. If set to true, a dummy model will be
            used that returns arbitrary catalog items. Note
            that the dryRun mode should only be used for
            testing the API, or if the model is not ready.
        params (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Optional. Additional domain specific parameters for the
            predictions.

            Allowed values:

            -  ``returnCatalogItem``: Boolean. If set to true, the
               associated catalogItem object will be returned in the
               ``PredictResponse.PredictionResult.itemMetadata`` object
               in the method response.
            -  ``returnItemScore``: Boolean. If set to true, the
               prediction 'score' corresponding to each returned item
               will be set in the ``metadata`` field in the prediction
               response. The given 'score' indicates the probability of
               an item being clicked/purchased given the user's context
               and history.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. The labels for the predict request.

            -  Label keys can contain lowercase letters, digits and
               hyphens, must start with a letter, and must end with a
               letter or digit.
            -  Non-zero label values can contain lowercase letters,
               digits and hyphens, must start with a letter, and must
               end with a letter or digit.
            -  No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given
               request.

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and
            examples of labels.
