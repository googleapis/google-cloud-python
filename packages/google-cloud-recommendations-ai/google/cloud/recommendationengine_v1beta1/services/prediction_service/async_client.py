                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

            name (:class:`str`):
                Required. Full resource name of the format:

                is used to identify the set of models that will be used
                to make the prediction.

                We currently support three placements with the following
                IDs by default:

                -  ``shopping_cart``: Predicts items frequently bought
                   together with one or more catalog items in the same
                   shopping session. Commonly displayed after
                   ``add-to-cart`` events, on product detail pages, or
                   on the shopping cart page.

                -  ``home_page``: Predicts the next product that a user
                   will most likely engage with or purchase based on the
                   shopping or viewing history of the specified
                   ``userId`` or ``visitorId``. For example -
                   Recommendations for you.

                -  ``product_detail``: Predicts the next product that a
                   user will most likely engage with or purchase. The
                   prediction is based on the shopping or viewing
                   history of the specified ``userId`` or ``visitorId``
                   and its relevance to a specified ``CatalogItem``.
                   Typically used on product detail pages. For example -
                   More items like this.

                -  ``recently_viewed_default``: Returns up to 75 items
                   recently viewed by the specified ``userId`` or
                   ``visitorId``, most recent ones first. Returns
                   nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet.
                   For example - Recently viewed.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            user_event (:class:`google.cloud.recommendationengine_v1beta1.types.UserEvent`):

                what they are looking at and what action
                they took to trigger the predict
                request. Note that this user event

                logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write
                request is required for event logging.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.
