class Scorecard(proto.Message):
    r"""A widget showing the latest value of a metric, and how this
    value relates to one or more thresholds.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        time_series_query (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.TimeSeriesQuery):
            Required. Fields for querying time series
            data from the Stackdriver metrics API.
        gauge_view (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.Scorecard.GaugeView):
            Will cause the scorecard to show a gauge
            chart.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``data_view``.
        spark_chart_view (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.Scorecard.SparkChartView):
            Will cause the scorecard to show a spark
            chart.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``data_view``.
        blank_view (google.protobuf.empty_pb2.Empty):
            Will cause the ``Scorecard`` to show only the value, with no
            indicator to its value relative to its thresholds.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``data_view``.
        thresholds (MutableSequence[google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.Threshold]):
            The thresholds used to determine the state of the scorecard
            given the time series' current value. For an actual value x,
            the scorecard is in a danger state if x is less than or
            equal to a danger threshold that triggers below, or greater
            than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above.
            Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that
            triggers above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning
            state - unless x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger
            trumps warning.)

            As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four
            thresholds:

            ::

               {
                 value: 90,
                 category: 'DANGER',
                 trigger: 'ABOVE',
               },
               {
                 value: 70,
                 category: 'WARNING',
                 trigger: 'ABOVE',
               },
               {
                 value: 10,
                 category: 'DANGER',
                 trigger: 'BELOW',
               },
               {
                 value: 20,
                 category: 'WARNING',
                 trigger: 'BELOW',
               }

            Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the
            scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less
            than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between
            20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70
            but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or
            equal to 90 a DANGER state.
