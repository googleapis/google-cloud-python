            per-istio-service-identity admission rule.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        comment (str):
            Optional. A descriptive comment. This field
            may be updated.
        id (str):
            The ID of this public key. Signatures verified by BinAuthz
            must include the ID of the public key that can be used to
            verify them, and that ID must match the contents of this
            field exactly. Additional restrictions on this field can be
            imposed based on which public key type is encapsulated. See
            the documentation on ``public_key`` cases below for details.
        ascii_armored_pgp_public_key (str):
            ASCII-armored representation of a PGP public key, as the
            entire output by the command
            ``gpg --export --armor foo@example.com`` (either LF or CRLF
            line endings). When using this field, ``id`` should be left
            blank. The BinAuthz API handlers will calculate the ID and
            fill it in automatically. BinAuthz computes this ID as the
            OpenPGP RFC4880 V4 fingerprint, represented as upper-case
            hex. If ``id`` is provided by the caller, it will be
            overwritten by the API-calculated ID.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``public_key``.
        pkix_public_key (google.cloud.binaryauthorization_v1.types.PkixPublicKey):
            A raw PKIX SubjectPublicKeyInfo format public key.

            NOTE: ``id`` may be explicitly provided by the caller when
            using this type of public key, but it MUST be a valid
            RFC3986 URI. If ``id`` is left blank, a default one will be
            computed based on the digest of the DER encoding of the
            public key.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``public_key``.
