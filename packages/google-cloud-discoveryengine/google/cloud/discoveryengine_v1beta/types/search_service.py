    method.

    Attributes:
        serving_config (str):
            Required. The resource name of the Search serving config,
            such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/*/servingConfigs/default_serving_config``,
            or
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/default_data_store/servingConfigs/default_serving_config``.
            This field is used to identify the serving configuration
            name, set of models used to make the search.
        branch (str):
            The branch resource name, such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/default_data_store/branches/0``.

            Use ``default_branch`` as the branch ID or leave this field
            empty, to search documents under the default branch.
        query (str):
            Raw search query.
        image_query (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.ImageQuery):
            Raw image query.
        page_size (int):
            Maximum number of
            [Document][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.Document]s to
            return. The maximum allowed value depends on the data type.
            Values above the maximum value are coerced to the maximum
            value.

            -  Websites with basic indexing: Default ``10``, Maximum
               ``25``.
            -  Websites with advanced indexing: Default ``25``, Maximum
               ``50``.
            -  Other: Default ``50``, Maximum ``100``.

            If this field is negative, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` is
            returned.
        page_token (str):
            A page token received from a previous
            [SearchService.Search][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchService.Search]
            call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            [SearchService.Search][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchService.Search]
            must match the call that provided the page token. Otherwise,
            an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error is returned.
        offset (int):
            A 0-indexed integer that specifies the current offset (that
            is, starting result location, amongst the
            [Document][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.Document]s
            deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field
            is only considered if
            [page_token][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.page_token]
            is unset.

            If this field is negative, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` is
            returned.
        data_store_specs (MutableSequence[google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.DataStoreSpec]):
            Specs defining dataStores to filter on in a
            search call and configurations for those
            dataStores. This is only considered for engines
            with multiple dataStores use case. For single
            dataStore within an engine, they should use the
            specs at the top level.
        filter (str):
            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for
            constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the
            documents being filtered. Filter expression is
            case-sensitive.

            If this field is unrecognizable, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` is
            returned.

            Filtering in Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS
            filter key to a key property defined in the Vertex AI Search
            backend -- this mapping is defined by the customer in their
            schema. For example a media customer might have a field
            'name' in their schema. In this case the filter would look
            like this: filter --> name:'ANY("king kong")'

            For more information about filtering including syntax and
            filter operators, see
            `Filter <https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/filter-search-metadata>`__
        canonical_filter (str):
            The default filter that is applied when a user performs a
            search without checking any filters on the search page.

            The filter applied to every search request when quality
            improvement such as query expansion is needed. In the case a
            query does not have a sufficient amount of results this
            filter will be used to determine whether or not to enable
            the query expansion flow. The original filter will still be
            used for the query expanded search. This field is strongly
            recommended to achieve high search quality.

            For more information about filter syntax, see
            [SearchRequest.filter][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.filter].
        order_by (str):
            The order in which documents are returned. Documents can be
            ordered by a field in an
            [Document][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.Document]
            object. Leave it unset if ordered by relevance. ``order_by``
            expression is case-sensitive.

            For more information on ordering for retail search, see
            `Ordering <https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-and-order#order>`__

            If this field is unrecognizable, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` is
            returned.
        user_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.UserInfo):
            Information about the end user. Highly recommended for
            analytics.
            [UserInfo.user_agent][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.UserInfo.user_agent]
            is used to deduce ``device_type`` for analytics.
        language_code (str):
            The BCP-47 language code, such as "en-US" or "sr-Latn". For
            more information, see `Standard
            fields <https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/standard_fields>`__.
            This field helps to better interpret the query. If a value
            isn't specified, the query language code is automatically
            detected, which may not be accurate.
        region_code (str):
            The Unicode country/region code (CLDR) of a location, such
            as "US" and "419". For more information, see `Standard
            fields <https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/standard_fields>`__.
            If set, then results will be boosted based on the
            region_code provided.
        facet_specs (MutableSequence[google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.FacetSpec]):
            Facet specifications for faceted search. If empty, no facets
            are returned.

            A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an
            ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error is returned.
        boost_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.BoostSpec):
            Boost specification to boost certain documents. For more
            information on boosting, see
            `Boosting <https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/boost-search-results>`__
        params (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Additional search parameters.

            For public website search only, supported values are:

            -  ``user_country_code``: string. Default empty. If set to
               non-empty, results are restricted or boosted based on the
               location provided. For example,
               ``user_country_code: "au"``

               For available codes see `Country
               Codes <https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/json_api_reference#countryCodes>`__

            -  ``search_type``: double. Default empty. Enables
               non-webpage searching depending on the value. The only
               valid non-default value is 1, which enables image
               searching. For example, ``search_type: 1``
        query_expansion_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.QueryExpansionSpec):
            The query expansion specification that
            specifies the conditions under which query
            expansion occurs.
        spell_correction_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.SpellCorrectionSpec):
            The spell correction specification that
            specifies the mode under which spell correction
            takes effect.
        user_pseudo_id (str):
            A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this
            could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be
            able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This
            unique identifier should not change if the visitor logs in
            or out of the website.

            This field should NOT have a fixed value such as
            ``unknown_visitor``.

            This should be the same identifier as
            [UserEvent.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.UserEvent.user_pseudo_id]
            and
            [CompleteQueryRequest.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.CompleteQueryRequest.user_pseudo_id]

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error
            is returned.
        content_search_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.ContentSearchSpec):
            A specification for configuring the behavior
            of content search.
        embedding_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec):
            Uses the provided embedding to do additional semantic
            document retrieval. The retrieval is based on the dot
            product of
            [SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec.EmbeddingVector.vector][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec.EmbeddingVector.vector]
            and the document embedding that is provided in
            [SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec.EmbeddingVector.field_path][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec.EmbeddingVector.field_path].

            If
            [SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec.EmbeddingVector.field_path][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.EmbeddingSpec.EmbeddingVector.field_path]
            is not provided, it will use
            [ServingConfig.EmbeddingConfig.field_path][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.ServingConfig.embedding_config].
        ranking_expression (str):
            The ranking expression controls the customized ranking on
            retrieval documents. This overrides
            [ServingConfig.ranking_expression][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.ServingConfig.ranking_expression].
            The ranking expression is a single function or multiple
            functions that are joined by "+".

            -  ranking_expression = function, { " + ", function };

            Supported functions:

            -  double \* relevance_score
            -  double \* dotProduct(embedding_field_path)

            Function variables:

            -  ``relevance_score``: pre-defined keywords, used for
               measure relevance between query and document.
            -  ``embedding_field_path``: the document embedding field
               used with query embedding vector.
            -  ``dotProduct``: embedding function between
               embedding_field_path and query embedding vector.

            Example ranking expression:

            ::

               If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the ranking expression
               could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 * dotProduct(doc_embedding)`.
        safe_search (bool):
            Whether to turn on safe search. This is only
            supported for website search.
        user_labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The user labels applied to a resource must meet the
            following requirements:

            -  Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum
               of 64.
            -  Each label must be a key-value pair.
            -  Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum
               length of 63 characters and cannot be empty. Values can
               be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters.
            -  Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters,
               numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All
               characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
               characters are allowed.
            -  The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you
               can use the same key with multiple resources.
            -  Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
               character.

            See `Google Cloud
            Document <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements>`__
            for more details.
        natural_language_query_understanding_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.NaturalLanguageQueryUnderstandingSpec):
            If ``naturalLanguageQueryUnderstandingSpec`` is not
            specified, no additional natural language query
            understanding will be done.
        search_as_you_type_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.SearchAsYouTypeSpec):
            Search as you type configuration. Only supported for the
            [IndustryVertical.MEDIA][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.IndustryVertical.MEDIA]
            vertical.
        session (str):
            The session resource name. Optional.

            Session allows users to do multi-turn /search API calls or
            coordination between /search API calls and /answer API
            calls.

            Example #1 (multi-turn /search API calls):

            1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below).
            2. Call /search API with the session ID generated in the
               first call. Here, the previous search query gets
               considered in query standing. I.e., if the first query is
               "How did Alphabet do in 2022?" and the current query is
               "How about 2023?", the current query will be interpreted
               as "How did Alphabet do in 2023?".

            Example #2 (coordination between /search API calls and
            /answer API calls):

            1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below).
            2. Call /answer API with the session ID generated in the
               first call. Here, the answer generation happens in the
               context of the search results from the first search call.

            Auto-session mode: when ``projects/.../sessions/-`` is used,
            a new session gets automatically created. Otherwise, users
            can use the create-session API to create a session manually.

            Multi-turn Search feature is currently at private GA stage.
            Please use v1alpha or v1beta version instead before we
            launch this feature to public GA. Or ask for allowlisting
            through Google Support team.
        session_spec (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1beta.types.SearchRequest.SessionSpec):
            Session specification.

            Can be used only when ``session`` is set.

            excluded_filter_keys (MutableSequence[str]):
                List of keys to exclude when faceting.

                By default,
                [FacetKey.key][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.FacetSpec.FacetKey.key]
                is not excluded from the filter unless it is listed in this
                field.

                Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to
                appear as facet results, even when they are filtered out of
                search results. Using this field does not affect what search
                results are returned.

                For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color
                facet "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A
                query containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having
                "color" as
                [FacetKey.key][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1beta.SearchRequest.FacetSpec.FacetKey.key]
                would by default return only "Red" documents in the search
                results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
                color facet. Although there are also blue documents
                available, "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet
                value.

                If "color" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query
                returns the facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue"
                with count 200, because the "color" key is now excluded from

            enable_dynamic_position (bool):
                Enables dynamic position for this facet. If set to true, the
                position of this facet among all facets in the response is
                determined automatically. If dynamic facets are enabled, it
                is ordered together. If set to false, the position of this
                facet in the response is the same as in the request, and it
                is ranked before the facets with dynamic position enable and
                all dynamic facets.

                For example, you may always want to have rating facet
                returned in the response, but it's not necessarily to always
                display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can
                set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of
                rating facet in response is determined automatically.

                Another example, assuming you have the following facets in
                the request:

                -  "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true

                -  "price", enable_dynamic_position = false

                -  "brands", enable_dynamic_position = false

                And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates
                a facet ``gender``. Then the final order of the facets in
                the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender")
                or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
                API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice
                that "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and
                second position because their enable_dynamic_position is
                false.

                    Setting to 1.0 gives the document a big promotion. However,
                    it does not necessarily mean that the boosted document will
                    be the top result at all times, nor that other documents

                    trump your heavily favored but irrelevant documents.

                    Setting to -1.0 gives the document a big demotion. However,
                    results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The

                    When this field is set to ``true``, summaries include

                    BigQuery is Google Cloud's fully managed and completely

                    The citation numbers refer to the returned search results
                    and are 1-indexed. For example, [1] means that the sentence
                    is attributed to the first search result. [2, 3] means that
                    the sentence is attributed to both the second and third

                    Google employs search-query classification to detect

                    Google employs search-query classification to detect
                    summary-seeking queries. No summary is returned if the
                    search query is classified as a non-summary seeking query.
                    For example, ``why is the sky blue`` and

                    The maximum number of extractive answers returned in each
                    search result.

                    An extractive answer is a verbatim answer extracted from the
                    original document, which provides a precise and contextually
                    relevant answer to the search query.

                    If the number of matching answers is less than the
                    ``max_extractive_answer_count``, return all of the answers.
                    Otherwise, return the ``max_extractive_answer_count``.

                    At most five answers are returned for each

                    An extractive segment is a text segment extracted from the
                    original document that is relevant to the search query, and,
                    in general, more verbose than an extractive answer. The
                    segment could then be used as input for LLMs to generate
                    summaries and answers.

                    If the number of matching segments is less than
                    ``max_extractive_segment_count``, return all of the
                    segments. Otherwise, return the

                If set, the search result gets stored to the "turn"

                Example: Let's say the session looks like this: session {
                name: ".../sessions/xxx" turns { query { text: "What is

                Then, the API stores the search result, associated with the
                last turn. The stored search result can be used by a
                subsequent /answer API call (with the session ID and the
