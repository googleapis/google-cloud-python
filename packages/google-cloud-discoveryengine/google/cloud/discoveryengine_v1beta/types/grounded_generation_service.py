               of 64.
            -  Each label must be a key-value pair.
            -  Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum
               length of 63 characters and cannot be empty. Values can
               be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters.
            -  Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters,
               numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All
               characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
               characters are allowed.
            -  The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you
               can use the same key with multiple resources.
            -  Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
               character.
