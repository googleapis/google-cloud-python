class UserEvent(proto.Message):
    r"""UserEvent captures all metadata information Discovery Engine
    API needs to know about how end users interact with customers'
    website.

    Attributes:
        event_type (str):
            Required. User event type. Allowed values are:

            Generic values:

            -  ``search``: Search for Documents.
            -  ``view-item``: Detailed page view of a Document.
            -  ``view-item-list``: View of a panel or ordered list of
               Documents.
            -  ``view-home-page``: View of the home page.
            -  ``view-category-page``: View of a category page, e.g.
               Home > Men > Jeans

            Retail-related values:

            -  ``add-to-cart``: Add an item(s) to cart, e.g. in Retail
               online shopping
            -  ``purchase``: Purchase an item(s)

            Media-related values:

            -  ``media-play``: Start/resume watching a video, playing a
               song, etc.
            -  ``media-complete``: Finished or stopped midway through a
               video, song, etc.
        user_pseudo_id (str):
            Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors.

            For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie,
            which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a
            single device. This unique identifier should not change if
            the visitor log in/out of the website.

            Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different
            users. This mixes the event history of those users together,
            which results in degraded model quality.

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error
            is returned.

            The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend
            to use Google Analytics `Client
            ID <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId>`__
            for this field.
        event_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Only required for
            [UserEventService.ImportUserEvents][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserEventService.ImportUserEvents]
            method. Timestamp of when the user event happened.
        user_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.UserInfo):
            Information about the end user.
        direct_user_request (bool):
            Should set to true if the request is made directly from the
            end user, in which case the
            [UserEvent.user_info.user_agent][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserInfo.user_agent]
            can be populated from the HTTP request.

            This flag should be set only if the API request is made
            directly from the end user such as a mobile app (and not if
            a gateway or a server is processing and pushing the user
            events).

            This should not be set when using the JavaScript tag in
            [UserEventService.CollectUserEvent][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserEventService.CollectUserEvent].
        session_id (str):
            A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a
            length limit of 128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an
            end user behavior in a time span.

            A general guideline to populate the session_id:

            1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id
               should be assigned.
            2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use
               uuid or add
               [UserEvent.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserEvent.user_pseudo_id]
               as prefix.
        page_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.PageInfo):
            Page metadata such as categories and other critical
            information for certain event types such as
            ``view-category-page``.
        attribution_token (str):
            Token to attribute an API response to user action(s) to
            trigger the event.

            Highly recommended for user events that are the result of
            [RecommendationService.Recommend][]. This field enables
            accurate attribution of recommendation model performance.

            The value must be one of:

            -  [RecommendResponse.attribution_token][] for events that
               are the result of [RecommendationService.Recommend][].
            -  [SearchResponse.attribution_token][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.SearchResponse.attribution_token]
               for events that are the result of
               [SearchService.Search][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.SearchService.Search].

            This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or
            conversion completion back to the event and the particular
            predict response containing this clicked/purchased product.
            If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results,
            pass [RecommendResponse.attribution_token][] as a URL
            parameter to product K's page. When recording events on
            product K's page, log the
            [RecommendResponse.attribution_token][] to this field.
        filter (str):
            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for
            constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the
            documents being filtered.

            One example is for ``search`` events, the associated
            [SearchRequest][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.SearchRequest]
            may contain a filter expression in
            [SearchRequest.filter][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.SearchRequest.filter]
            conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering.

            Similarly, for ``view-item-list`` events that are generated
            from a [RecommendRequest][], this field may be populated
            directly from [RecommendRequest.filter][] conforming to
            https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering.

            The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``
            error is returned.
        documents (MutableSequence[google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.DocumentInfo]):
            List of
            [Document][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.Document]s
            associated with this user event.

            This field is optional except for the following event types:

            -  ``view-item``
            -  ``add-to-cart``
            -  ``purchase``
            -  ``media-play``
            -  ``media-complete``

            In a ``search`` event, this field represents the documents
            returned to the end user on the current page (the end user
            may have not finished browsing the whole page yet). When a
            new page is returned to the end user, after
            pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new
            ``search`` event with different
            [UserEvent.documents][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserEvent.documents]
            is desired.
        panel (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.PanelInfo):
            Panel metadata associated with this user
            event.
        search_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.SearchInfo):
            [SearchService.Search][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.SearchService.Search]
            details related to the event.

            This field should be set for ``search`` event.
        completion_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.CompletionInfo):
            [CompletionService.CompleteQuery][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.CompletionService.CompleteQuery]
            details related to the event.

            This field should be set for ``search`` event when
            autocomplete function is enabled and the user clicks a
            suggestion for search.
        transaction_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.TransactionInfo):
            The transaction metadata (if any) associated
            with this user event.
        tag_ids (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of identifiers for the independent
            experiment groups this user event belongs to.
            This is used to distinguish between user events
            associated with different experiment setups on
            the customer end.
        promotion_ids (MutableSequence[str]):
            The promotion IDs if this is an event
            associated with promotions. Currently, this
            field is restricted to at most one ID.
        attributes (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.CustomAttribute]):
            Extra user event features to include in the recommendation
            model. These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to
            be parsed or processed further, e.g. JSON or other
            encodings.

            If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events,
            also include them in the user events that you associate with
            prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be
            consistent between imported events and events provided with
            prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use
            those custom attributes when training models and serving
            predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality.

            This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an
            ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error is returned:

            -  The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length
               limit of 5,000 characters.
            -  For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.
               Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8
               encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters.
            -  For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.

            For product recommendations, an example of extra user
            information is ``traffic_channel``, which is how a user
            arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming
            to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in
            other ways.
        media_info (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.MediaInfo):

            A unique ID of a web page view.

            This should be kept the same for all user events triggered
            from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page

            When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript
            pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in

            with the transaction. This value may include
            shipping, tax, or other adjustments to the total
            value that you want to include.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_value``.
        currency (str):
            Required. Currency code. Use three-character
            ISO-4217 code.
        transaction_id (str):
            The transaction ID with a length limit of 128
            characters.
        tax (float):
            All the taxes associated with the
            transaction.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_tax``.
        cost (float):
            All the costs associated with the products. These can be
            manufacturing costs, shipping expenses not borne by the end
            user, or any other costs, such that:

            -  Profit =
               [value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.value]
               -
               [tax][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.tax]
               -
               [cost][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.cost]

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cost``.
        discount_value (float):
            The total discount(s) value applied to this transaction.
            This figure should be excluded from
            [TransactionInfo.value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.value]

            For example, if a user paid
            [TransactionInfo.value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.value]
            amount, then nominal (pre-discount) value of the transaction
            is the sum of
            [TransactionInfo.value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.value]
            and
            [TransactionInfo.discount_value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.discount_value]

            This means that profit is calculated the same way,
            regardless of the discount value, and that
            [TransactionInfo.discount_value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.discount_value]
            can be larger than
            [TransactionInfo.value][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.TransactionInfo.value]:
