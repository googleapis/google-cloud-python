class RecommendRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request message for Recommend method.

    Attributes:
        serving_config (str):
            Required. Full resource name of a
            [ServingConfig][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.ServingConfig]:
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/engines/*/servingConfigs/*``,
            or
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/dataStores/*/servingConfigs/*``

            One default serving config is created along with your
            recommendation engine creation. The engine ID is used as the
            ID of the default serving config. For example, for Engine
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/engines/my-engine``,
            you can use
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/engines/my-engine/servingConfigs/my-engine``
            for your
            [RecommendationService.Recommend][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.RecommendationService.Recommend]
            requests.
        user_event (google.cloud.discoveryengine_v1.types.UserEvent):
            Required. Context about the user, what they are looking at
            and what action they took to trigger the Recommend request.
            Note that this user event detail won't be ingested to
            userEvent logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write request is
            required for event logging.

            Don't set
            [UserEvent.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserEvent.user_pseudo_id]
            or
            [UserEvent.user_info.user_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserInfo.user_id]
            to the same fixed ID for different users. If you are trying
            to receive non-personalized recommendations (not
            recommended; this can negatively impact model performance),
            instead set
            [UserEvent.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserEvent.user_pseudo_id]
            to a random unique ID and leave
            [UserEvent.user_info.user_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.UserInfo.user_id]
            unset.
        page_size (int):
            Maximum number of results to return. Set this
            property to the number of recommendation results
            needed. If zero, the service chooses a
            reasonable default. The maximum allowed value is
            100. Values above 100 are set to 100.
        filter (str):
            Filter for restricting recommendation results with a length
            limit of 5,000 characters. Currently, only filter
            expressions on the ``filter_tags`` attribute is supported.

            Examples:

            -  ``(filter_tags: ANY("Red", "Blue") OR filter_tags: ANY("Hot", "Cold"))``
            -  ``(filter_tags: ANY("Red", "Blue")) AND NOT (filter_tags: ANY("Green"))``

            If ``attributeFilteringSyntax`` is set to true under the
            ``params`` field, then attribute-based expressions are
            expected instead of the above described tag-based syntax.
            Examples:

            -  (launguage: ANY("en", "es")) AND NOT (categories:
               ANY("Movie"))
            -  (available: true) AND (launguage: ANY("en", "es")) OR
               (categories: ANY("Movie"))

            If your filter blocks all results, the API returns generic
            (unfiltered) popular Documents. If you only want results
            strictly matching the filters, set ``strictFiltering`` to
            ``true`` in
            [RecommendRequest.params][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.RecommendRequest.params]
            to receive empty results instead.

            Note that the API never returns
            [Document][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.Document]s with
            ``storageStatus`` as ``EXPIRED`` or ``DELETED`` regardless
            of filter choices.
        validate_only (bool):
            Use validate only mode for this recommendation query. If set
            to ``true``, a fake model is used that returns arbitrary
            Document IDs. Note that the validate only mode should only
            be used for testing the API, or if the model is not ready.
        params (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Additional domain specific parameters for the
            recommendations.

            Allowed values:

            -  ``returnDocument``: Boolean. If set to ``true``, the
               associated Document object is returned in
               [RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.document][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.document].
            -  ``returnScore``: Boolean. If set to true, the
               recommendation score corresponding to each returned
               Document is set in
               [RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.metadata][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.metadata].
               The given score indicates the probability of a Document
               conversion given the user's context and history.
            -  ``strictFiltering``: Boolean. True by default. If set to
               ``false``, the service returns generic (unfiltered)
               popular Documents instead of empty if your filter blocks
               all recommendation results.
            -  ``diversityLevel``: String. Default empty. If set to be
               non-empty, then it needs to be one of:

               -  ``no-diversity``
               -  ``low-diversity``
               -  ``medium-diversity``
               -  ``high-diversity``
               -  ``auto-diversity`` This gives request-level control
                  and adjusts recommendation results based on Document
                  category.

            -  ``attributeFilteringSyntax``: Boolean. False by default.
               If set to true, the ``filter`` field is interpreted
               according to the new, attribute-based syntax.
        user_labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The user labels applied to a resource must meet the
            following requirements:

            -  Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum
               of 64.
            -  Each label must be a key-value pair.
            -  Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum
               length of 63 characters and cannot be empty. Values can
               be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters.
            -  Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters,
               numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All
               characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
               characters are allowed.
            -  The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you
               can use the same key with multiple resources.
            -  Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
               character.

            See `Requirements for
            labels <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements>`__
            for more details.
