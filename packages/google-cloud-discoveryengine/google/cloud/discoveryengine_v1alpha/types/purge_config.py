    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. The resource name of the catalog under which the
            events are created. The format is
            ``projects/${projectId}/locations/global/collections/{$collectionId}/dataStores/${dataStoreId}``
        filter (str):
            Required. The filter string to specify the events to be
            deleted with a length limit of 5,000 characters. The
            eligible fields for filtering are:

            -  ``eventType``: Double quoted
               [UserEvent.event_type][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.UserEvent.event_type]
               string.
            -  ``eventTime``: in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
            -  ``userPseudoId``: Double quoted string. Specifying this
               will delete all events associated with a visitor.
            -  ``userId``: Double quoted string. Specifying this will
               delete all events associated with a user.

            Examples:

            -  Deleting all events in a time range:
               ``eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"``
            -  Deleting specific eventType: ``eventType = "search"``
            -  Deleting all events for a specific visitor:
               ``userPseudoId = "visitor1024"``
            -  Deleting all events inside a DataStore: ``*``

            The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
        force (bool):
            The ``force`` field is currently not supported. Purge user
            event requests will permanently delete all purgeable events.
            Once the development is complete: If ``force`` is set to
            false, the method will return the expected purge count
            without deleting any user events. This field will default to
            false if not included in the request.
