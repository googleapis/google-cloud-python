    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for ArtifactRegistry.

    The Artifact Registry API service.

    Artifact Registry is an artifact management system for storing
    artifacts from different package management systems.

    The resources managed by this API are:

    - Repositories, which group packages and their data.
    - Packages, which group versions and their tags.
    - Versions, which are specific forms of a package.
    - Tags, which represent alternative names for versions.
    - Files, which contain content and are optionally associated with a
      Package or Version.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
