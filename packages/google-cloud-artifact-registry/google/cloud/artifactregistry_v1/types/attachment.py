            The name of the attachment. E.g.
            ``projects/p1/locations/us/repositories/repo/attachments/sbom``.
        target (str):
            Required. The target the attachment is for, can be a
            Version, Package or Repository. E.g.

            Type of attachment. E.g. ``application/vnd.spdx+json``
        attachment_namespace (str):
            The namespace this attachment belongs to. E.g. If an
            attachment is created by artifact analysis, namespace is set
            to ``artifactanalysis.googleapis.com``.
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. User annotations. These attributes
            can only be set and used by the user, and not by
            Artifact Registry. See

            details such as format and size limitations.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time when the attachment was
            created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time when the attachment was
            last updated.
        files (MutableSequence[str]):
            Required. The files that belong to this attachment. If the
            file ID part contains slashes, they are escaped. E.g.
            ``projects/p1/locations/us-central1/repositories/repo1/files/sha:<sha-of-file>``.
        oci_version_name (str):
            Output only. The name of the OCI version that this
            attachment created. Only populated for Docker attachments.
