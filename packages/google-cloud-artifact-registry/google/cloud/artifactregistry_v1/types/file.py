    Attributes:

            Required. The name of the repository whose
            files will be listed. For example:
            "projects/p1/locations/us-central1/repositories/repo1
        filter (str):
            An expression for filtering the results of the request.
            Filter rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for
            filtering are:

            -  ``name``
            -  ``owner``
            -  ``annotations``

            Examples of using a filter:

            To filter the results of your request to files with the name
            ``my_file.txt`` in project ``my-project`` in the
            ``us-central`` region, in repository ``my-repo``, append the
            following filter expression to your request:

            -  ``name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/files/my-file.txt"``

            You can also use wildcards to match any number of characters
            before or after the value:

            -  ``name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/files/my-*"``
            -  ``name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/files/*file.txt"``
            -  ``name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/files/*file*"``

            To filter the results of your request to files owned by the
            version ``1.0`` in package ``pkg1``, append the following
            filter expression to your request:

            -  ``owner="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package/versions/1.0"``

            To filter the results of your request to files with the
            annotation key-value pair [``external_link``:
            ``external_link_value``], append the following filter
            expression to your request:

            -  ``"annotations.external_link:external_link_value"``

            To filter just for a specific annotation key
            ``external_link``, append the following filter expression to
            your request:

            -  ``"annotations.external_link"``

            If the annotation key or value contains special characters,
            you can escape them by surrounding the value with backticks.
            For example, to filter the results of your request to files
            with the annotation key-value pair
            [``external.link``:``https://example.com/my-file``], append
            the following filter expression to your request:

            -  :literal:`"annotations.`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-file`"`

            You can also filter with annotations with a wildcard to
            match any number of characters before or after the value:

            -  :literal:`"annotations.*_link:`*example.com*`"`
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of files to return.
            Maximum page size is 1,000.
        page_token (str):
            The next_page_token value returned from a previous list
            request, if any.
        order_by (str):
            The field to order the results by.
