    """gRPC backend transport for ArtifactRegistry.

    The Artifact Registry API service.

    Artifact Registry is an artifact management system for storing
    artifacts from different package management systems.

    The resources managed by this API are:

    -  Repositories, which group packages and their data.
    -  Packages, which group versions and their tags.
    -  Versions, which are specific forms of a package.
    -  Tags, which represent alternative names for versions.
    -  Files, which contain content and are optionally associated with a
       Package or Version.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the

                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``

            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create

                ``api_mtls_endpoint`` is None.
            ssl_channel_credentials (grpc.ChannelCredentials): SSL credentials

                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.
