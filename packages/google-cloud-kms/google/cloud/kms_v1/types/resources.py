    [CryptoKeys][google.cloud.kms.v1.CryptoKey] and
    [CryptoKeyVersions][google.cloud.kms.v1.CryptoKeyVersion] using
    pre-existing key material, generated outside of Cloud KMS.

    When an [ImportJob][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob] is created, Cloud
    KMS will generate a "wrapping key", which is a public/private key
    pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also known as wrap) the
    pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process.
    The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of
    [import_method][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob.import_method]. When
    the wrapping key generation is complete, the
    [state][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob.state] will be set to
    [ACTIVE][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob.ImportJobState.ACTIVE] and
    the [public_key][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob.public_key] can be
    fetched. The fetched public key can then be used to wrap your
    pre-existing key material.

    Once the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new
    [CryptoKeyVersion][google.cloud.kms.v1.CryptoKeyVersion] in an
    existing [CryptoKey][google.cloud.kms.v1.CryptoKey] by calling
    [ImportCryptoKeyVersion][google.cloud.kms.v1.KeyManagementService.ImportCryptoKeyVersion].
    Multiple [CryptoKeyVersions][google.cloud.kms.v1.CryptoKeyVersion]
    can be imported with a single
    [ImportJob][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob]. Cloud KMS uses the
    private key portion of the wrapping key to unwrap the key material.
    Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key.

    An [ImportJob][google.cloud.kms.v1.ImportJob] expires 3 days after
    it is created. Once expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to
    import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped with the

                ephemeral AES key, and wrapping the ephemeral AES key with a
                4096 bit RSA key. For more details, see `RSA AES key wrap
