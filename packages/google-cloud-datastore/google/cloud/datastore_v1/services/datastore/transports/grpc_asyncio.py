class DatastoreGrpcAsyncIOTransport(DatastoreTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for Datastore.

    Each RPC normalizes the partition IDs of the keys in its
    input entities, and always returns entities with keys with
    normalized partition IDs. This applies to all keys and entities,
    including those in values, except keys with both an empty path
    and an empty or unset partition ID. Normalization of input keys
    sets the project ID (if not already set) to the project ID from
    the request.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
