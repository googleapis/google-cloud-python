    Google Cloud Datastore Admin API

    The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for
    Cloud Datastore.

    Concepts: Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the
    Google Cloud Datastore API.

    Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the
    background.

    EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a
    project. This is specified as a combination of kinds and
    namespaces (either or both of which may be all).

    Export/Import Service:

    - The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or
      a subset of entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
    - Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any
      Google Cloud Platform project. It is not restricted to the
      export source project. It is possible to export from one
      project and then import into another.
    - Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for
      analysis.
    - Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation
      resource is created for each export/import. The state
      (including any errors encountered) of the export/import may be
      queried via the Operation resource.

    Index Service:

    - The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
    - Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously. An
      Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous
      operation. The state of the operation (including any errors
      encountered) may be queried via the Operation resource.

    Operation Service:

    - The Operations collection provides a record of actions
      performed for the specified project (including any operations
      in progress). Operations are not created directly but through
      calls on other collections or resources.
    - An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The
      request to cancel is asynchronous and the operation may
      continue to run for some time after the request to cancel is
      made.
    - An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no
      longer listed as part of the Operation collection.
    - ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not
      completed operations.
    - Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin, but are
      accessed via service google.longrunning.Operations.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
