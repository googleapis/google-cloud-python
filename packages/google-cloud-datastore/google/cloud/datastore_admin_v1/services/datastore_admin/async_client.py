class DatastoreAdminAsyncClient:
    """Google Cloud Datastore Admin API

    The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for
    Cloud Datastore.

    Concepts: Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the
    Google Cloud Datastore API.

    Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the
    background.

    EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a
    project. This is specified as a combination of kinds and
    namespaces (either or both of which may be all).

    Export/Import Service:

    - The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or
      a subset of entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
    - Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any
      Google Cloud Platform project. It is not restricted to the
      export source project. It is possible to export from one
      project and then import into another.
    - Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for
      analysis.
    - Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation
      resource is created for each export/import. The state
      (including any errors encountered) of the export/import may be
      queried via the Operation resource.

    Index Service:

    - The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
    - Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously. An
      Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous
      operation. The state of the operation (including any errors
      encountered) may be queried via the Operation resource.

    Operation Service:

    - The Operations collection provides a record of actions
      performed for the specified project (including any operations
      in progress). Operations are not created directly but through
      calls on other collections or resources.
    - An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The
      request to cancel is asynchronous and the operation may
      continue to run for some time after the request to cancel is
      made.
    - An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no
      longer listed as part of the Operation collection.
    - ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not
      completed operations.
    - Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin, but are
      accessed via service google.longrunning.Operations.

                Custom options for the client.

                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                This corresponds to the ``project_id`` field

            output_url_prefix (:class:`str`):
                Required. Location for the export metadata and data
                files.

                The full resource URL of the external storage location.
                Currently, only Google Cloud Storage is supported. So
                output_url_prefix should be of the form:
                ``gs://BUCKET_NAME[/NAMESPACE_PATH]``, where
                ``BUCKET_NAME`` is the name of the Cloud Storage bucket
                and ``NAMESPACE_PATH`` is an optional Cloud Storage
                namespace path (this is not a Cloud Datastore
                namespace). For more information about Cloud Storage
                namespace paths, see `Object name
                considerations <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming#object-considerations>`__.

                The resulting files will be nested deeper than the
                specified URL prefix. The final output URL will be
                provided in the

                field. That value should be used for subsequent
                ImportEntities operations.

                By nesting the data files deeper, the same Cloud Storage
                bucket can be used in multiple ExportEntities operations
                without conflict.

                This corresponds to the ``output_url_prefix`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,
                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                be of type `bytes`.

        Returns:
            google.api_core.operation_async.AsyncOperation:
                An object representing a long-running operation.

                The result type for the operation will be :class:`google.cloud.datastore_admin_v1.types.ExportEntitiesResponse` The response for

                [google.datastore.admin.v1.DatastoreAdmin.ImportEntities][google.datastore.admin.v1.DatastoreAdmin.ImportEntities].
            project_id (:class:`str`):
                Required. Project ID against which to
                make the request.

                This corresponds to the ``project_id`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            labels (:class:`MutableMapping[str, str]`):
                Client-assigned labels.
                This corresponds to the ``labels`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            input_url (:class:`str`):
                Required. The full resource URL of the external storage
                location. Currently, only Google Cloud Storage is
                supported. So input_url should be of the form:
                ``gs://BUCKET_NAME[/NAMESPACE_PATH]/OVERALL_EXPORT_METADATA_FILE``,
                where ``BUCKET_NAME`` is the name of the Cloud Storage
                bucket, ``NAMESPACE_PATH`` is an optional Cloud Storage
                namespace path (this is not a Cloud Datastore
                namespace), and ``OVERALL_EXPORT_METADATA_FILE`` is the
                metadata file written by the ExportEntities operation.
                For more information about Cloud Storage namespace
                paths, see `Object name

                This corresponds to the ``input_url`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            entity_filter (:class:`google.cloud.datastore_admin_v1.types.EntityFilter`):
                Optionally specify which kinds/namespaces are to be
                imported. If provided, the list must be a subset of the
                EntityFilter used in creating the export, otherwise a
                FAILED_PRECONDITION error will be returned. If no filter
                is specified then all entities from the export are
                imported.

                This corresponds to the ``entity_filter`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,
                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                be of type `bytes`.
