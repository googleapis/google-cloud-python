                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                   A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds
                   one or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                   Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                   Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role
                   is a named list of permissions; each role can be an
                   IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

                   For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding
                   can also specify a condition, which is a logical
                   expression that allows access to a resource only if
                   the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add
                   constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                   resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                   conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
                   documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

                An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
                   controls for Google Cloud resources.

                   A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds
                   one or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                   Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                   Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role
                   is a named list of permissions; each role can be an
                   IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

                   For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding
                   can also specify a condition, which is a logical
                   expression that allows access to a resource only if
                   the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add
                   constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                   resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                   conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
                   documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
