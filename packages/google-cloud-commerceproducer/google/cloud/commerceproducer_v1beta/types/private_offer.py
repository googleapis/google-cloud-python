        customer (google.cloud.commerceproducer_v1beta.types.PrivateOffer.Customer):
            Optional. Information identifying the
            intended recipient of the offer. Must be
            provided when publishing the offer.
        accept_deadline_time (google.type.datetime_pb2.DateTime):
            Optional. Deadline for acceptance of published offers. A
            published offer not accepted by this time will expire. Only
            day boundaries in the America/Los_Angeles time zone are
            supported. Must be present to publish the offer.

            When publishing an offer the deadline must be set to a time
            in the future not more than 3 months from the time of
            publishing. For example, if the offer is published on 03/05
            at 1PM, then the deadline must be at or before 06/05 12AM
            America/Los_Angeles time.

            The deadline must also be:

            - Before or equal to the scheduled start time of this offer
              (if ``term.scheduled_start_time`` is set and the term's
              start policy is ``SCHEDULED_START_TIME``).
            - Before or equal to the scheduled end time of this offer,
              if ``term.scheduled_end_time`` is set and the term's end
              policy is ``SCHEDULED_END_TIME``.
            - Before or equal to the upcoming installment start times on
              this offer.
            - Before or equal to the amended offer's end time, if the
              offer amends another private or standard offer.
            - Before or equal to the start time of the next pending
              installment of the amended offer, if amending a private
              offer with custom installments. For example, if the
              amended offer has installments on 01/01, 02/01, 03/01,
              04/01, and today is 02/15, then this offer's
              ``accept_deadline_time`` must be at or before 03/01.

            In addition, if the offer amends another private offer, but
            there is already an accepted upcoming amendment against that
            private offer, then this deadline must be before or equal to
            the start time of the accepted upcoming offer. For example,
            today is 02/15, and this offer (offer C) amends private
            offer A, and private offer B has already been accepted which
            also amends private offer A. Private offer B has a start
            time of 03/01. Then this deadline must be at or before
            03/01. Otherwise, on 03/01, private offer B would take
            effect, superseding offer A. This would mean offer C is no
            longer amending the currently active offer (Offer A), which
            is required for valid amendments.

            Once the offer is published, this field is still updatable
            to extend the deadline of the offer. However, the extension
            is still limited to be at most 3 months from the time of
            publishing.
        term (google.cloud.commerceproducer_v1beta.types.PrivateOffer.Term):

                If that date is not available, the offer will end on the

                control whether they renew the offer.

                Allowing a customer to renew an offer does not constitute a
                guarantee to the customer that the offered product will
                still be available to be renewed at the renewal date.

                An offer with a max renewal count of 0 cannot be renewed.

                    For example, if the amended offer starts on 01/15/24, and
                    has a duration of 6 months, then it ends on 07/15/24. If the

                    offer starts on 05/06/24, then it will still end on
                    07/15/24. Assuming the current offer renews 3 times, then
                    the terms on the current offer will be:

                    1. 05/06/24 - 07/15/24 (First term, ends on 07/15 to coterm
                       with the amended offer)

                    As a contrast, if the current offer does not coterm with the
                    amended offer (such as when ``end_policy`` is
                    ``AFTER_DURATION``), then the terms will be:

                       coterming)
                    2. 11/06/24 - 05/06/25 (First renewal term)
                    3. 05/06/25 - 11/06/25 (Second renewal term)
                    4. 11/06/25 - 05/06/26 (Third renewal term)

                    - ``single_product_offer.amended_private_offer`` must be
                      set, and the amended private offer must not be ended.
                    - The proration policy must not change (e.g., you cannot

            amended_private_offer (str):
                Optional. An existing private offer that will be superseded
                by this offer. Unless the private offer is for a product
                type that supports `multiple active
                orders <https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/offers/multiple-offers>`__,
                an amendment private offer must be transacted if and only if
                the destination customer billing account already contains an
                active order for the same product. The offer to be
                superseded must be the offer associated with an active
                order.

                Amendments generally fall into one of two scenarios:

                1. **Active Order / Ended Offer**: The term of the amended
                   offer has ended but it is still associated with an active
                   order. The new offer must amend the ended private offer.
                2. **Active Order / Active Offer**: The term of the amended
                   offer is still active and the associated order is active.
                   Similar to above, the new offer must amend the currently
                   active offer (unless "multiple active orders" are
                   supported).

                If this is set, then the ``base_standard_offer`` parent
                service must match the parent service of the
                ``base_standard_offer`` in the ``amended_private_offer``.

                **Active Term Restrictions**: If the term of the amended
                private offer has *NOT* ended, then the following
                compatibility rules apply:

                - **Price Model Compatibility**:

                  - Flat Fee (with or without usage) offers can amend Flat
                    Fee offers.
                  - Usage-only or CUD offers can amend usage-only offers.
                  - Commitment-based offers must amend offers of the same
                    price model subtype (e.g., "additional usage at list
                    price" vs "all usage discounted").

                - **Billing Frequency Compatibility**: Determined by
                  ``standard_interval`` or ``custom_interval_price``.

                  - If the amended offer has a custom billing frequency, the
                    new offer must also have a custom frequency.
                  - If the amended offer has a standard frequency (Monthly,
                    Quarterly, or Yearly), the new offer must maintain the
                    same frequency or transition to a custom frequency.
                  - Switching between different standard frequencies (e.g.,
                    Monthly to Quarterly) is not supported.
                  - For Monthly frequency, switching between
                    ``MONTHLY_PRORATED`` and ``MONTHLY_NOT_PRORATED`` is
                    supported, unless the offer's ``term.end_policy`` is
                    ``MATCH_AMENDED_OFFER``.
                  - For usage-only offers, there are no billing frequency
                    restrictions.

                be transacted. The offer to be superseded must be the offer
                associated with the active order.

                If this is set, then the ``base_standard_offer`` must

                  or Flat Fee with usage standard offers.

                  standard offers.

            models based on the combination of fields set in the price model.
            The following terminology is used in documentation and other
            reference material.

            - Usage-based: the price model does not set ``flat_fee``
            - Usage-only: the price model sets only ``usage``
            - CUD (committed use discount): the price model sets ``commitment``

              - Commitment discount with additional usage at list price: The
                price model sets ``commitment`` and not ``usage``.
              - Commitment with all usage discounted: The price model sets
                ``commitment`` and ``usage``.

            - Flat fee: the price model sets only ``flat_fee``
            - Flat fee with usage: the price model sets ``flat_fee`` and
              ``usage``

    Used to attach documents to a private offer in state DRAFT. Once
    a private offer is no longer in state DRAFT, the set of child
    documents is immutable. Existing documents cannot be updated or
    deleted, and new documents cannot be added.

    A private offer must include a EULA, either by assigning a
    standard EULA or attaching a custom EULA document, or a
    statement of work document.
