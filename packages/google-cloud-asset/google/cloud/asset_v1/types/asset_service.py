            snapshot result should be written. If this table
            does not exist, a new table with the given name
            will be created.
        force (bool):
            If the destination table already exists and this flag is
            ``TRUE``, the table will be overwritten by the contents of
            assets snapshot. If the flag is ``FALSE`` or unset and the
            destination table already exists, the export call returns an
            INVALID_ARGUMEMT error.
        partition_spec (google.cloud.asset_v1.types.PartitionSpec):
            [partition_spec] determines whether to export to partitioned
            table(s) and how to partition the data.

            If [partition_spec] is unset or
            [partition_spec.partition_key] is unset or
            ``PARTITION_KEY_UNSPECIFIED``, the snapshot results will be
            exported to non-partitioned table(s). [force] will decide
            whether to overwrite existing table(s).

            If [partition_spec] is specified. First, the snapshot
            results will be written to partitioned table(s) with two
            additional timestamp columns, readTime and requestTime, one
            of which will be the partition key. Secondly, in the case
            when any destination table already exists, it will first try
            to update existing table's schema as necessary by appending
            additional columns. Then, if [force] is ``TRUE``, the
            corresponding partition will be overwritten by the snapshot
            results (data in different partitions will remain intact);
            if [force] is unset or ``FALSE``, it will append the data.
            An error will be returned if the schema update or data
            appension fails.
        separate_tables_per_asset_type (bool):
            If this flag is ``TRUE``, the snapshot results will be
            written to one or multiple tables, each of which contains
            results of one asset type. The [force] and [partition_spec]
            fields will apply to each of them.

            Field [table] will be concatenated with "*" and the asset
            type names (see
            https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types
            for supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table
            names, in which all non-alphanumeric characters like "." and
            "/" will be substituted by "*". Example: if field [table] is
            "mytable" and snapshot results contain
            "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket" assets, the corresponding
            table name will be "mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket".
            If any of these tables does not exist, a new table with the
            concatenated name will be created.

            When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is
            ``RESOURCE``, the schema of each table will include
            RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in the
            Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15
            nested level BigQuery supports
            (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)).
            The fields in >15 nested levels will be stored in JSON
            format string as a child column of its parent RECORD column.

            If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole
            export call will return an error but the export results that
            already succeed will persist. Example: if exporting to
            table_type_A succeeds when exporting to table_type_B fails
            during one export call, the results in table_type_A will
            persist and there will not be partial results persisting in

        asset_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. A list of asset types that this request searches
            for. If empty, it will search all the asset types `supported
            by search
            APIs <https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types>`__.

            Regular expressions are also supported. For example:

               with "Instance".
            -  ".*Instance.*" snapshots resources whose asset type
               contains "Instance".

            See `RE2 <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>`__ for
            all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular
            expression does not match any supported asset type, an
            INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page
            size is capped at 500 even if a larger value is given. If
            set to zero or a negative value, server will pick an
            appropriate default. Returned results may be fewer than
            requested. When this happens, there could be more results as
            long as ``next_page_token`` is returned.
        page_token (str):
            Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of
            results from the preceding call to this method.
            ``page_token`` must be the value of ``next_page_token`` from
            the previous response. The values of all other method
            parameters, must be identical to those in the previous call.
        order_by (str):
            Optional. A comma-separated list of fields specifying the
            sorting order of the results. The default order is
            ascending. Add " DESC" after the field name to indicate
            descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.
            Example: "location DESC, name". Only the following fields in
            the response are sortable:

            -  name
            -  assetType
            -  project

            -  parentFullResourceName
            -  parentAssetType
        read_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            Optional. A comma-separated list of fields that you want
            returned in the results. The following fields are returned
            by default if not specified:

            -  ``name``
            -  ``assetType``
            -  ``project``
            -  ``folders``
            -  ``organization``
            -  ``displayName``
            -  ``description``
            -  ``location``
            -  ``labels``
            -  ``tags``
            -  ``effectiveTags``
            -  ``networkTags``
            -  ``kmsKeys``
            -  ``createTime``
            -  ``updateTime``
            -  ``state``
            -  ``additionalAttributes``
            -  ``parentFullResourceName``
            -  ``parentAssetType``

            Some fields of large size, such as ``versionedResources``,
            ``attachedResources``, ``effectiveTags`` etc., are not
            returned by default, but you can specify them in the
            ``read_mask`` parameter if you want to include them. If
            ``"*"`` is specified, all `available
            fields <https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/searchAllResources#resourcesearchresult>`__
            are returned. Examples: ``"name,location"``,
            ``"name,versionedResources"``, ``"*"``. Any invalid field
            path will trigger INVALID_ARGUMENT error.

            for more information. If not specified or empty, it will

            Note that the query string is compared against each IAM
            policy binding, including its principals, roles, and IAM
            conditions. The returned IAM policies will only contain the

            Examples:

               find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing
               "storage.buckets.update" permission. Note that if callers
               don't have ``iam.roles.get`` access to a role's included
               permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will
               be dropped from the search results.
            -  ``policy.role.permissions:upd*`` to find IAM policy
               bindings that specify a role containing "upd" as a prefix

               permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will
               be dropped from the search results.
            -  ``resource:organizations/123456`` to find IAM policy

        asset_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. A list of asset types that the IAM policies are
