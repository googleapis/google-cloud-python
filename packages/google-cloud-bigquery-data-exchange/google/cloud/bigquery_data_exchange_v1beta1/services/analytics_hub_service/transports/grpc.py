    """gRPC backend transport for AnalyticsHubService.

    The AnalyticsHubService API facilitates data sharing within
    and across organizations. It allows data providers to publish
    Listings --- a discoverable and searchable SKU representing a
    dataset. Data consumers can subscribe to Listings. Upon
    subscription, AnalyticsHub provisions a "Linked Datasets"
    surfacing the data in the consumer's project.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
