        Enables debugging on a VM instance. This allows you
        to use the SSH command to connect to the virtual machine
        where the instance lives. While in "debug mode", the
        instance continues to serve live traffic. You should
        delete the instance when you are done debugging and then
        allow the system to take over and determine if another
        instance should be started.

        Only applicable for instances in App Engine flexible
        environment.
