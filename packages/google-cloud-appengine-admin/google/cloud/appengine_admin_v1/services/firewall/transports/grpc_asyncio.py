class FirewallGrpcAsyncIOTransport(FirewallTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for Firewall.

    Firewall resources are used to define a collection of access
    control rules for an Application. Each rule is defined with a
    position which specifies the rule's order in the sequence of
    rules, an IP range to be matched against requests, and an action
    to take upon matching requests.

    Every request is evaluated against the Firewall rules in
    priority order. Processesing stops at the first rule which
    matches the request's IP address. A final rule always specifies
    an action that applies to all remaining IP addresses. The
    default final rule for a newly-created application will be set
    to "allow" if not otherwise specified by the user.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
