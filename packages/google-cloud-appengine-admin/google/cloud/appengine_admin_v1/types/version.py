    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Full path to the Version resource in the API. Example:
            ``apps/myapp/services/default/versions/v1``.

            @OutputOnly
        id (str):
            Relative name of the version within the service. Example:
            ``v1``. Version names can contain only lowercase letters,
            numbers, or hyphens. Reserved names: "default", "latest",
            and any name with the prefix "ah-".
        automatic_scaling (google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.AutomaticScaling):
            Automatic scaling is based on request rate,
            response latencies, and other application
            metrics. Instances are dynamically created and
            destroyed as needed in order to handle traffic.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scaling``.
        basic_scaling (google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.BasicScaling):
            A service with basic scaling will create an
            instance when the application receives a
            request. The instance will be turned down when
            the app becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for
            work that is intermittent or driven by user
            activity.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scaling``.
        manual_scaling (google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.ManualScaling):
            A service with manual scaling runs
            continuously, allowing you to perform complex
            initialization and rely on the state of its
            memory over time. Manually scaled versions are
            sometimes referred to as "backends".

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scaling``.
        inbound_services (MutableSequence[google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.InboundServiceType]):
            Before an application can receive email or
            XMPP messages, the application must be
            configured to enable the service.
        instance_class (str):
            Instance class that is used to run this version. Valid
            values are:

            -  AutomaticScaling: ``F1``, ``F2``, ``F4``, ``F4_1G``
            -  ManualScaling or BasicScaling: ``B1``, ``B2``, ``B4``,
               ``B8``, ``B4_1G``

            Machine resources for this version.
            Only applicable in the App Engine flexible

            An ordered list of URL-matching patterns that should be

            configuration ID. The ``config_id`` field is used to give
            the configuration ID and is required in this case.

            Endpoints also has a rollout strategy called
            ``RolloutStrategy.MANAGED``. When using this, Endpoints
            fetches the latest configuration and does not need the
            configuration ID. In this case, ``config_id`` must be
            omitted.

            be specified. If ``MANAGED``, ``config_id`` must be omitted.
