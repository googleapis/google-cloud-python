class BackupChannel(proto.Message):
    r"""A BackupChannel imposes constraints on where clusters can be backed
    up. The BackupChannel should be in the same project and region as
    the cluster being backed up. The backup can be created only in
    destination_project.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The fully qualified name of the BackupChannel.
            ``projects/*/locations/*/backupChannels/*``
        destination_project (str):
            Required. Immutable. The project where Backups are allowed
            to be stored. The format is ``projects/{project}``.
            Currently, {project} can only be the project number. Support
            for project IDs will be added in the future.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of
            `UUID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__
            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            BackupChannel resource was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            BackupChannel resource was last updated.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by
            user.
        description (str):
            Optional. User specified descriptive string
            for this BackupChannel.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            BackupChannel from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupChannel updates in
            order to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in
            the response to ``GetBackupChannel``, and systems are
            expected to put that etag in the request to
            ``UpdateBackupChannel`` or ``DeleteBackupChannel`` to ensure
            that their change will be applied to the same version of the
            resource.
        destination_project_id (str):
            Output only. The project_id where Backups are allowed to be
            stored. Example Project ID: "my-project-id". This will be an
            OUTPUT_ONLY field to return the project_id of the
            destination project.
