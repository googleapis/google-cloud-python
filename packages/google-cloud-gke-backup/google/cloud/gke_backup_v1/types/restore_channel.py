class RestoreChannel(proto.Message):
    r"""A RestoreChannel imposes constraints on where backups can be
    restored. The RestoreChannel should be in the same project and
    region as the backups. The backups can only be restored in the
    ``destination_project``.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The fully qualified name of the RestoreChannel.
            ``projects/*/locations/*/restoreChannels/*``
        destination_project (str):
            Required. Immutable. The project into which the backups will
            be restored. The format is ``projects/{project}``.
            Currently, {project} can only be the project number. Support
            for project IDs will be added in the future.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of
            `UUID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__
            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            RestoreChannel was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            RestoreChannel was last updated.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by
            user.
        description (str):
            Optional. User specified descriptive string
            for this RestoreChannel.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            RestoreChannel from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform RestoreChannel updates in
            order to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in
            the response to ``GetRestoreChannel``, and systems are
            expected to put that etag in the request to
            ``UpdateRestoreChannel`` or ``DeleteRestoreChannel`` to
            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version
            of the resource.
        destination_project_id (str):
            Output only. The project_id where backups will be restored.
            Example Project ID: "my-project-id". This will be an
            OUTPUT_ONLY field to return the project_id of the
            destination project.
