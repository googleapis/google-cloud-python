    This resource is created automatically when a BackupPlan is
    created using a BackupChannel. This also serves as a holder for
    cross-project fields that need to be displayed in the current
    project.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The fully qualified name of the
            BackupPlanBinding.
            ``projects/*/locations/*/backupChannels/*/backupPlanBindings/*``
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of
            `UUID4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this binding
            was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this binding
            was created.
        backup_plan (str):
            Output only. Immutable. The fully qualified name of the
            BackupPlan bound with the parent BackupChannel.
            ``projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/{backup_plan}``
        cluster (str):

            Output only. Contains details about the
            backup plan/backup.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            BackupPlanBinding from overwriting each other. It is
            strongly suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in
            the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlanBinding
            updates in order to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is
            returned in the response to ``GetBackupPlanBinding``, and
            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to
            ``UpdateBackupPlanBinding`` or ``DeleteBackupPlanBinding``
            to ensure that their change will be applied to the same
            version of the resource.
