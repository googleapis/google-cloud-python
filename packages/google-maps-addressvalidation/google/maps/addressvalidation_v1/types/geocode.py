class Geocode(proto.Message):
    r"""Contains information about the place the input was geocoded
    to.

    Attributes:
        location (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            The geocoded location of the input.
            Using place IDs is preferred over using
            addresses, latitude/longitude coordinates, or
            plus codes. Using coordinates when routing or
            calculating driving directions will always
            result in the point being snapped to the road
            nearest to those coordinates. This may not be a
            road that will quickly or safely lead to the
            destination and may not be near an access point
            to the property. Additionally, when a location
            is reverse geocoded, there is no guarantee that
            the returned address will match the original.
        plus_code (google.maps.addressvalidation_v1.types.PlusCode):
            The plus code corresponding to the ``location``.
        bounds (google.geo.type.types.Viewport):
            The bounds of the geocoded place.
        feature_size_meters (float):
            The size of the geocoded place, in meters.
            This is another measure of the coarseness of the
            geocoded location, but in physical size rather
            than in semantic meaning.
        place_id (str):
            The PlaceID of the place this input geocodes to.

            For more information about Place IDs see
            `here <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id>`__.
        place_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            The type(s) of place that the input geocoded to. For
            example, ``['locality', 'political']``. The full list of
            types can be found
            `here <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/requests-geocoding#Types>`__.
