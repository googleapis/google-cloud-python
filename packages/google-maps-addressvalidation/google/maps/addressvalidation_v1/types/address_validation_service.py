    Attributes:
        address (google.type.postal_address_pb2.PostalAddress):
            Required. The address being validated. Unformatted addresses
            should be submitted via
            [``address_lines``][google.type.PostalAddress.address_lines].

            The total length of the fields in this input must not exceed
            280 characters.

            Supported regions can be found in the
            `FAQ <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/faq#which_regions_are_currently_supported>`__.

            The [language_code][google.type.PostalAddress.language_code]
            value in the input address is reserved for future uses and
            is ignored today. The validated address result will be
            populated based on the preferred language for the given
            address, as identified by the system.

            The Address Validation API ignores the values in
            [recipients][google.type.PostalAddress.recipients] and
            [organization][google.type.PostalAddress.organization]. Any
            values in those fields will be discarded and not returned.
            Please do not set them.
        previous_response_id (str):
            This field must be empty for the first address validation
            request. If more requests are necessary to fully validate a
            single address (for example if the changes the user makes
            after the initial validation need to be re-validated), then
            each followup request must populate this field with the
            [response_id][google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidateAddressResponse.response_id]
            from the very first response in the validation sequence.
        enable_usps_cass (bool):

            [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult]. Note:
            for USPS CASS enabled requests for addresses in Puerto Rico,
            a [google.type.PostalAddress.region_code] of the ``address``
            must be provided as "PR", or an
            [google.type.PostalAddress.administrative_area] of the

            (case-insensitive) or "PR".

            alternatively specify at least two
            [google.type.PostalAddress.address_lines] where the first
            line contains the street number and name and the second line
            contains the city, state, and zip code.

            The granularity of the **input** address. This is the result

            validation signals. For validation signals, refer to
            ``validation_granularity`` below.

            For example, if the input address includes a specific
            apartment number, then the ``input_granularity`` here will
            be ``SUB_PREMISE``. If we cannot match the apartment number
            in the databases or the apartment number is invalid, the
            ``validation_granularity`` will likely be ``PREMISE`` or
            below.
        validation_granularity (google.maps.addressvalidation_v1.types.Verdict.Granularity):
            The granularity level that the API can fully **validate**
            the address to. For example, an ``validation_granularity``
            of ``PREMISE`` indicates all address components at the level
            of ``PREMISE`` or more coarse can be validated.

            Per address component validation result can be found in
            [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.Address.address_components].
        geocode_granularity (google.maps.addressvalidation_v1.types.Verdict.Granularity):
            Information about the granularity of the
            [``geocode``][google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult.geocode].
            This can be understood as the semantic meaning of how coarse
            or fine the geocoded location is.

            This can differ from the ``validation_granularity`` above
            occasionally. For example, our database might record the
            existence of an apartment number but do not have a precise
            location for the apartment within a big apartment complex.
            In that case, the ``validation_granularity`` will be
            ``SUB_PREMISE`` but the ``geocode_granularity`` will be
            ``PREMISE``.
        address_complete (bool):

        has_unconfirmed_components (bool):
            At least one address component cannot be categorized or
            validated, see
            [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.Address.address_components]

        something like "Redwood City, CA, 94061" identifies a ``LOCALITY``.
        However, if we are unable to find a geocode for "123 Main Street" in
