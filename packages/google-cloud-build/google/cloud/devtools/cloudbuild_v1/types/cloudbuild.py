        args (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when
            it is started.

            If the image used to run the step's container has an
            entrypoint, the ``args`` are used as arguments to that
            entrypoint. If the image does not define an entrypoint, the
            first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
            remainder will be used as arguments.
        dir_ (str):
            Working directory to use when running this step's container.

            If this value is a relative path, it is relative to the
            build's working directory. If this value is absolute, it may
            be outside the build's working directory, in which case the
            contents of the path may not be persisted across build step
            executions, unless a ``volume`` for that path is specified.

            If the build specifies a ``RepoSource`` with ``dir`` and a
            step with a ``dir``, which specifies an absolute path, the
            ``RepoSource`` ``dir`` is ignored for the step's execution.
        id (str):
            Unique identifier for this build step, used in ``wait_for``
            to reference this build step as a dependency.
        wait_for (MutableSequence[str]):
            The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
            This build step will not start until all the build steps in
            ``wait_for`` have completed successfully. If ``wait_for`` is
            empty, this build step will start when all previous build
            steps in the ``Build.Steps`` list have completed
            successfully.
        entrypoint (str):
            Entrypoint to be used instead of the build
            step image's default entrypoint. If unset, the
            image's default entrypoint is used.
        secret_env (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of environment variables which are encrypted using a
            Cloud Key Management Service crypto key. These values must
            be specified in the build's ``Secret``.
        volumes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.Volume]):
            List of volumes to mount into the build step.

            Each volume is created as an empty volume prior
            to execution of the build step. Upon completion
            of the build, volumes and their contents are
            discarded.

            Using a named volume in only one step is not
            valid as it is indicative of a build request
            with an incorrect configuration.
        timing (google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.TimeSpan):
            Output only. Stores timing information for
            executing this build step.
        pull_timing (google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.TimeSpan):
            Output only. Stores timing information for
            pulling this build step's builder image only.
        timeout (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Time limit for executing this build step. If
            not defined, the step has no time limit and will
            be allowed to continue to run until either it
            completes or the build itself times out.
        status (google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.Build.Status):
            Output only. Status of the build step. At
            this time, build step status is only updated on
            build completion; step status is not updated in
            real-time as the build progresses.
        allow_failure (bool):
            Allow this build step to fail without failing the entire
            build.

            If false, the entire build will fail if this step fails.
            Otherwise, the build will succeed, but this step will still
            have a failure status. Error information will be reported in
            the failure_detail field.
        exit_code (int):
            Output only. Return code from running the
            step.
        allow_exit_codes (MutableSequence[int]):
            Allow this build step to fail without failing the entire
            build if and only if the exit code is one of the specified
            codes. If allow_failure is also specified, this field will
            take precedence.
        script (str):
            A shell script to be executed in the step.

            When script is provided, the user cannot specify
            the entrypoint or args.
        automap_substitutions (bool):
            Option to include built-in and custom
            substitutions as env variables for this build
            step. This option will override the global
            option in BuildOption.

            credentials.

            The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the
            ``Build`` resource's results field.

            If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build status is
            marked ``FAILURE``.

            TTL in queue for this build. If provided and the build is
            enqueued longer than this value, the build will expire and
            the build status will be ``EXPIRED``.

            The TTL starts ticking from create_time.
        artifacts (google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.Artifacts):
            Artifacts produced by the build that should
            be uploaded upon successful completion of all

            If ignored_files and changed files are both empty, then they
            are not used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.

            If ignored_files is not empty, then we ignore any files that
            match any of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no

            ignored_files filter and included_files is empty, then as
            far as this filter is concerned, we should trigger the
            build.

            If any of the files altered in the commit pass the
            ignored_files filter and included_files is not empty, then
            we make sure that at least one of those files matches a
            included_files glob. If not, then we do not trigger a build.
        filter (str):
            Optional. A Common Expression Language
            string.
        source_to_build (google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.GitRepoSource):

            to build. This field is used only for those
            triggers that do not respond to SCM events.
            Triggers that respond to such events build
            source at whatever commit caused the event.

            Pub/Sub, Manual, and Cron triggers.
        service_account (str):
            The service account used for all user-controlled operations
            including UpdateBuildTrigger, RunBuildTrigger, CreateBuild,
            and CancelBuild. If no service account is set, then the
            standard Cloud Build service account
            ([PROJECT_NUM]@system.gserviceaccount.com) will be used
