                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``

           the retried build will use the identical source.

        For builds that specify ``StorageSource``:

        -  If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage
           without specifying the generation of the object, the new
           build will use the current object, which may be different
           from the original build source.
        -  If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and
           specified the generation of the object, the new build will
           attempt to use the same object, which may or may not be
           available depending on the bucket's lifecycle management
           settings.

                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.
