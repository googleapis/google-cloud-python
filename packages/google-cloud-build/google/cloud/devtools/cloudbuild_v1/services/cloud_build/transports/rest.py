class CloudBuildRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for CloudBuild.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the CloudBuildRestTransport.

                be expanded when the build is created:

                -  $PROJECT_ID: the project ID of the build.

                -  $LOCATION: the location/region of the build.
                -  $BUILD_ID: the autogenerated ID of the build.
                -  $REPO_NAME: the source repository name specified by
                   RepoSource.
                -  $BRANCH_NAME: the branch name specified by
                   RepoSource.
                -  $TAG_NAME: the tag name specified by RepoSource.
                -  $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA: the commit SHA specified
                   by RepoSource or resolved from the specified branch
                   or tag.
                -  $SHORT_SHA: first 7 characters of $REVISION_ID or
                   $COMMIT_SHA.

                At a high level, a ``Build`` describes where to find
                source code, how to build it (for example, the builder
                image to run on the source), and where to store the
                built artifacts.

                Fields can include the following variables, which will
                be expanded when the build is created:

                -  $PROJECT_ID: the project ID of the build.
                -  $PROJECT_NUMBER: the project number of the build.
                -  $LOCATION: the location/region of the build.
                -  $BUILD_ID: the autogenerated ID of the build.
                -  $REPO_NAME: the source repository name specified by
                   RepoSource.
                -  $BRANCH_NAME: the branch name specified by
                   RepoSource.
                -  $TAG_NAME: the tag name specified by RepoSource.
                -  $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA: the commit SHA specified
                   by RepoSource or resolved from the specified branch
                   or tag.
                -  $SHORT_SHA: first 7 characters of $REVISION_ID or
                   $COMMIT_SHA.

                will use a worker from this pool.

                If your build needs access to resources on a private
                network, create and use a ``WorkerPool`` to run your
                builds. Private ``WorkerPool``\ s give your builds
                access to any single VPC network that you administer,
                including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC
                network. For an overview of private pools, see `Private
                pools
