class CloudBuildGrpcTransport(CloudBuildTransport):
    """gRPC backend transport for CloudBuild.

    Creates and manages builds on Google Cloud Platform.

    The main concept used by this API is a ``Build``, which describes
    the location of the source to build, how to build the source, and
    where to store the built artifacts, if any.

    A user can list previously-requested builds or get builds by their
    ID to determine the status of the build.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

        -  If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID,

        -  If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage
           without specifying the generation of the object, the new
           build will use the current object, which may be different
