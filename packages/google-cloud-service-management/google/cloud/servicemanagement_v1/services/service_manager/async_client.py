                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A

                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.

                Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy.
                It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud
                Platform resources.
                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.
