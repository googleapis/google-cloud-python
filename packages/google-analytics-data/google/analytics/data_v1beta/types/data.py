    Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the
    cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were
    acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for
    the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week
    of September cohort is specified in the ``cohort`` object. Following
    that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the
    ``cohortsRange`` object.

    For examples, see `Cohort Report
    Examples <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples>`__.

    The report response could show a weekly time series where say your
    app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of
    this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated
    by the metric ``cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers`` and will be
    separate rows in the report.
