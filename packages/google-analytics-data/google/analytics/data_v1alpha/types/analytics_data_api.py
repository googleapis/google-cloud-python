    different webhook notifications to the same long-running
    operation resource.

    Attributes:
        uri (str):
            Optional. The web address that will receive the webhook
            notification. This address will receive POST requests as the
            state of the long running operation resource changes. The
            POST request will contain both a JSON version of the long
            running operation resource in the body and a
            ``sentTimestamp`` field. The sent timestamp will specify the
            unix microseconds since the epoch that the request was sent;
            this lets you identify replayed notifications.

            An example URI is
            ``https://us-central1-example-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/example-function-1``.

            The URI must use HTTPS and point to a site with a valid SSL
            certificate on the web server. The URI must have a maximum
            string length of 128 characters & use only the allowlisted
            characters from `RFC
            1738 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738>`__.

            When your webhook server receives a notification, it is
            expected to reply with an HTTP response status code of 200
            within 5 seconds.

            A URI is required to use webhook notifications.

            Requests to this webhook server will contain an ID token
            authenticating the service account
            ``google-analytics-audience-export@system.gserviceaccount.com``.
            To learn more about ID tokens, see
            https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/token-types#id.
            For Google Cloud Functions, this lets you configure your
            function to require authentication. In Cloud IAM, you will
            need to grant the service account permissions to the Cloud
            Run Invoker (``roles/run.invoker``) & Cloud Functions
            Invoker (``roles/cloudfunctions.invoker``) roles for the
            webhook post request to pass Google Cloud Functions
            authentication. This API can send webhook notifications to

            tokens allow you to verify the source of a webhook
            notification. This guards against the message being spoofed.
            The channel token will be specified in the
            ``X-Goog-Channel-Token`` HTTP header of the webhook POST
            request.

            an audience list fails during creation. A common
            reason for such a failure is quota exhaustion.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_error_message``.
        percentage_completed (float):

        recurring_audience_list (str):
            Output only. The recurring audience list that
            created this audience list. Recurring audience
            lists create audience lists daily.

            If audience lists are created directly, they

        webhook_notification (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.WebhookNotification):
            Optional. Configures webhook notifications to
            be sent from the Google Analytics Data API to
            your webhook server. Use of webhooks is
            optional. If unused, you'll need to poll this
            API to determine when an audience list is ready
            to be used. Webhooks allow a notification to be
            sent to your servers & avoid the need for
            polling.

            Either one or two POST requests will be sent to
            the webhook. The first POST request will be sent
            immediately showing the newly created audience
            list in its CREATING state. The second POST
            request will be sent after the audience list
            completes creation (either the ACTIVE or FAILED
            state).

            If identical audience lists are requested in
            quick succession, the second & subsequent
            audience lists can be served from cache. In that
            case, the audience list create method can return
            an audience list is already ACTIVE. In this
            scenario, only one POST request will be sent to
            the webhook.

            evaluated in each segment.

            Each segment specified in this request
            produces a separate row in the response; in the

        dimension_filter (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.FilterExpression):
            Optional. Dimension filters allow you to ask for only
            specific dimension values in the report. To learn more, see
            `Creating a Report: Dimension
            Filters <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#dimension_filters>`__

        Attributes:
            dimensions (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.Dimension]):
                Optional. The dimensions requested and
                displayed.
            metrics (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.Metric]):
                Optional. The metrics requested and
                displayed.
            date_ranges (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.DateRange]):
                Optional. Date ranges of data to read. If multiple date
                ranges are requested, each response row will contain a zero
                based date range index. If two date ranges overlap, the

                response rows for both date ranges. In a cohort request,
                this ``dateRanges`` must be unspecified.
            dimension_filter (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.FilterExpression):
                Optional. Dimension filters let you ask for only specific
                dimension values in the report. To learn more, see
                `Fundamentals of Dimension
                Filters <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#dimension_filters>`__
                for examples. Metrics cannot be used in this filter.
            metric_filter (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.FilterExpression):
                Optional. The filter clause of metrics.
                Applied after aggregating the report's rows,
                similar to SQL having-clause. Dimensions cannot
                be used in this filter.
            offset (int):
                Optional. The row count of the start row from Google
                Analytics Storage. The first row is counted as row 0.

                When creating a report task, the ``offset`` and ``limit``
                parameters define the subset of data rows from Google
                Analytics storage to be included in the generated report.
                For example, if there are a total of 300,000 rows in Google
                Analytics storage, the initial report task may have the
                first 10,000 rows with a limit of 10,000 and an offset of 0.
                Subsequently, another report task could cover the next
                10,000 rows with a limit of 10,000 and an offset of 10,000.
            limit (int):
                Optional. The number of rows to return in the Report. If
                unspecified, 10,000 rows are returned. The API returns a
                maximum of 250,000 rows per request, no matter how many you
                ask for. ``limit`` must be positive.

                The API can also return fewer rows than the requested
                ``limit``, if there aren't as many dimension values as the
                ``limit``. For instance, there are fewer than 300 possible
                values for the dimension ``country``, so when reporting on
                only ``country``, you can't get more than 300 rows, even if
                you set ``limit`` to a higher value.
            metric_aggregations (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.MetricAggregation]):
                Optional. Aggregation of metrics. Aggregated metric values
                will be shown in rows where the dimension_values are set to
                "RESERVED_(MetricAggregation)".
            order_bys (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.OrderBy]):
                Optional. Specifies how rows are ordered in
                the response.
            currency_code (str):
                Optional. A currency code in ISO4217 format,
                such as "AED", "USD", "JPY". If the field is
                empty, the report uses the property's default
                currency.
            cohort_spec (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.CohortSpec):
                Optional. Cohort group associated with this
                request. If there is a cohort group in the
                request the 'cohort' dimension must be present.
            keep_empty_rows (bool):
                Optional. If false or unspecified, each row with all metrics
                equal to 0 will not be returned. If true, these rows will be
                returned if they are not separately removed by a filter.

                Regardless of this ``keep_empty_rows`` setting, only data
                recorded by the Google Analytics property can be displayed
                in a report.

                For example if a property never logs a ``purchase`` event,
                then a query for the ``eventName`` dimension and
                ``eventCount`` metric will not have a row containing
                eventName: "purchase" and eventCount: 0.
            sampling_level (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.SamplingLevel):
                Optional. The report's sampling level.

                Simultaneously, the ``total_row_count`` is 30, indicating
                the presence of data for all 30 rows. The ``task_row_count``
                can be utilizated to paginate through the initial 20 rows.
                To expand the report and include data from all 30 rows, a
                new report task can be created using the total_row_count to

        offset (int):
            Optional. The row count of the start row in the report. The
            first row is counted as row 0.

            When paging, the first request does not specify offset; or
            equivalently, sets offset to 0; the first request returns
            the first ``limit`` of rows. The second request sets offset
            to the ``limit`` of the first request; the second request
            returns the second ``limit`` of rows.

            `Pagination <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination>`__.
        limit (int):
            Optional. The number of rows to return from the report. If
            unspecified, 10,000 rows are returned. The API returns a
            maximum of 250,000 rows per request, no matter how many you
            ask for. ``limit`` must be positive.

            The API can also return fewer rows than the requested
            ``limit``, if there aren't as many dimension values as the
            ``limit``. The number of rows available to a
            QueryReportTaskRequest is further limited by the limit of
            the associated ReportTask. A query can retrieve at most
            ReportTask.limit rows. For example, if the ReportTask has a
            limit of 1,000, then a QueryReportTask request with
            offset=900 and limit=500 will return at most 100 rows.
