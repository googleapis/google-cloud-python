        Creates a recurring audience list. Recurring audience lists
        produces new audience lists each day. Audience lists are users
        in an audience at the time of the list's creation.

        A recurring audience list ensures that you have audience list
        based on the most recent data available for use each day. If you
        manually create audience list, you don't know when an audience
        list based on an additional day's data is available. This
        recurring audience list automates the creation of an audience
        list when an additional day's data is available. You will
        consume fewer quota tokens by using recurring audience list
        versus manually creating audience list at various times of day
        trying to guess when an additional day's data is ready.
