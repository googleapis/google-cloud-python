                The selected objects include system objects
                that aren't supported for migration.
            UNSUPPORTED_TABLES_WITH_REPLICA_IDENTITY (52):
                The source database has tables with the FULL
                or NOTHING replica identity. Before starting
                your migration, either remove the identity or
                change it to DEFAULT. Note that this is an error
                and will block the migration.
            SELECTED_OBJECTS_NOT_EXIST_ON_SOURCE (53):
                The selected objects don't exist on the
                source instance.

                Selected objects reference unselected
                objects. Based on their object type (foreign key
                constraint or view), selected objects will fail
                during migration.
            PROMPT_DELETE_EXISTING (56):
                The migration will delete existing data in the replica; set
                [replica_overwrite_enabled][google.cloud.sql.v1beta4.SqlInstancesStartExternalSyncRequest.replica_overwrite_enabled]
                in the request to acknowledge this. This is an error. MySQL

                The migration will delete existing data in the replica;
                [replica_overwrite_enabled][google.cloud.sql.v1beta4.SqlInstancesStartExternalSyncRequest.replica_overwrite_enabled]
                was set in the request acknowledging this. This is a warning
                rather than an error. MySQL only.
            PG_DDL_REPLICATION_INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE (58):
                The replication user is missing specific
                privileges to setup DDL replication. (e.g.

class IpConfiguration(proto.Message):
    r"""IP Management configuration.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        ipv4_enabled (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Whether the instance is assigned a public IP
            address or not.
        private_network (str):
            The resource link for the VPC network from which the Cloud
            SQL instance is accessible for private IP. For example,
            ``/projects/myProject/global/networks/default``. This
            setting can be updated, but it cannot be removed after it is
            set.
        require_ssl (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Use ``ssl_mode`` instead.

            Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP are enforced. If set to
            false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS
            connections. For SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate
            won't be verified. If set to true, then only allow
            connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client
            certificates. If you want to enforce SSL/TLS without
            enforcing the requirement for valid client certificates,
            then use the ``ssl_mode`` flag instead of the legacy
            ``require_ssl`` flag.
        authorized_networks (MutableSequence[google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.types.AclEntry]):
            The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to
            the instance using the IP. In 'CIDR' notation, also known as
            'slash' notation (for example: ``157.197.200.0/24``).
        allocated_ip_range (str):
            The name of the allocated ip range for the private ip Cloud
            SQL instance. For example:
            "google-managed-services-default". If set, the instance ip
            will be created in the allocated range. The range name must
            comply with `RFC
            1035 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035>`__. Specifically,
            the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
            expression ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.``
        enable_private_path_for_google_cloud_services (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Controls connectivity to private IP instances
            from Google services, such as BigQuery.
        ssl_mode (google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.types.IpConfiguration.SslMode):
            Specify how SSL/TLS is enforced in database connections. If
            you must use the ``require_ssl`` flag for backward
            compatibility, then only the following value pairs are
            valid:

            For PostgreSQL and MySQL:

            - ``ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED`` and
              ``require_ssl=false``
            - ``ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY`` and ``require_ssl=false``
            - ``ssl_mode=TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED`` and
              ``require_ssl=true``

            For SQL Server:

            - ``ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED`` and
              ``require_ssl=false``
            - ``ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY`` and ``require_ssl=true``

            The value of ``ssl_mode`` has priority over the value of
            ``require_ssl``.

            For example, for the pair ``ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY`` and
            ``require_ssl=false``, ``ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY`` means
            accept only SSL connections, while ``require_ssl=false``
            means accept both non-SSL and SSL connections. In this case,
            MySQL and PostgreSQL databases respect ``ssl_mode`` and
            accepts only SSL connections.
        psc_config (google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.types.PscConfig):
            PSC settings for this instance.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_psc_config``.
        server_ca_mode (google.cloud.sql_v1beta4.types.IpConfiguration.CaMode):
            Specify what type of CA is used for the
            server certificate.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_server_ca_mode``.
        custom_subject_alternative_names (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. Custom Subject Alternative
            Name(SAN)s for a Cloud SQL instance.
        server_ca_pool (str):
            Optional. The resource name of the server CA pool for an
            instance with ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA`` as the
            ``server_ca_mode``. Format:

                replica operation. Effect of a promote operation
                to the old primary is executed in this
                operation, asynchronously from the promote
                replica operation executed to the replica.
            CLUSTER_MAINTENANCE (45):
                Indicates that the instance, its read
                replicas, and its cascading replicas are in

                unavailable for 1-3 minutes.
            SELF_SERVICE_MAINTENANCE (46):
                Indicates that the instance (and any of its
                replicas) are currently in maintenance. This is
                initiated as a self-service request by using
                SSM. Maintenance typically causes the instance
                to be unavailable for 1-3 minutes.
            SWITCHOVER_TO_REPLICA (47):
