            For example, for the pair ``ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY`` and

            accept only SSL connections, while ``require_ssl=false``

            MySQL and PostgreSQL databases respect ``ssl_mode`` and

            UPDATE_BACKUP (40):
                Update a backup.
            ACQUIRE_SSRS_LEASE (42):
                Acquire a lease for the setup of SQL Server
                Reporting Services (SSRS).
            RELEASE_SSRS_LEASE (43):

                Reporting Services (SSRS).
            RECONFIGURE_OLD_PRIMARY (44):
                Reconfigures old primary after a promote
                replica operation. Effect of a promote operation
                to the old primary is executed in this
                operation, asynchronously from the promote
                replica operation executed to the replica.
            CLUSTER_MAINTENANCE (45):
                Indicates that the instance, its read
                replicas, and its cascading replicas are in
                maintenance. Maintenance typically gets
                initiated on groups of replicas first, followed
                by the primary instance. For each instance,
                maintenance typically causes the instance to be
                unavailable for 1-3 minutes.
            SELF_SERVICE_MAINTENANCE (46):
                Indicates that the instance (and any of its
                replicas) are currently in maintenance. This is
                initiated as a self-service request by using
                SSM. Maintenance typically causes the instance
                to be unavailable for 1-3 minutes.
            SWITCHOVER_TO_REPLICA (47):
                Switches a primary instance to a replica.
                This operation runs as part of a switchover
                operation to the original primary instance.
            MAJOR_VERSION_UPGRADE (48):
                Updates the major version of a Cloud SQL
                instance.
            ADVANCED_BACKUP (49):
                Deprecated: ADVANCED_BACKUP is deprecated. Use
                ENHANCED_BACKUP instead.
            MANAGE_BACKUP (50):
                Changes the BackupTier of a Cloud SQL
                instance.
            ENHANCED_BACKUP (51):
                Creates a backup for an Enhanced BackupTier
                Cloud SQL instance.
            REPAIR_READ_POOL (52):
                Repairs entire read pool or specified read
                pool nodes in the read pool.
            CREATE_READ_POOL (53):
                Creates a Cloud SQL read pool instance.
            PRE_CHECK_MAJOR_VERSION_UPGRADE (54):
                Pre-checks the major version upgrade
                operation.
            SETUP_MIGRATION (55):
