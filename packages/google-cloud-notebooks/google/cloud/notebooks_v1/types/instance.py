            index (int):
                A zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is
                reserved for the boot disk. If you have many
                disks attached to an instance, each disk would
                have a unique index number.
            interface (str):
                Indicates the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,
                which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI.
                Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will
                fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other
                format than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI.
                For performance characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see Local
                SSD performance. Valid values:

                -  ``NVME``

                The mode in which to attach this disk, either ``READ_WRITE``
                or ``READ_ONLY``. If not specified, the default is to attach
                the disk in ``READ_WRITE`` mode. Valid values:
