    to a VM.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        nfs (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.NFS):
            A Network File System (NFS) volume. For
            example, a Filestore file share.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        pd (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.PD):
            Deprecated: please use device_name instead.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        gcs (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.GCS):
            A Google Cloud Storage (GCS) volume.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        device_name (str):
            Device name of an attached disk volume, which should align
            with a device_name specified by
            job.allocation_policy.instances[0].policy.disks[i].device_name
            or defined by the given instance template in
            job.allocation_policy.instances[0].instance_template.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        mount_path (str):
            The mount path for the volume, e.g.
            /mnt/disks/share.
        mount_options (MutableSequence[str]):
            For Google Cloud Storage (GCS), mount options
            are the options supported by the gcsfuse tool
            (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse).
            For existing persistent disks, mount options
            provided by the mount command
            (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html)
            except writing are supported. This is due to
            restrictions of multi-writer mode
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms).
            For other attached disks and Network File System
            (NFS), mount options are these supported by the
            mount command
            (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html).
