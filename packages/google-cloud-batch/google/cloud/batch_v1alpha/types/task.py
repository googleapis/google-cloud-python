class ComputeResource(proto.Message):
    r"""Compute resource requirements.

    ComputeResource defines the amount of resources required for each
    task. Make sure your tasks have enough resources to successfully
    run. If you also define the types of resources for a job to use with
    the
    `InstancePolicyOrTemplate <https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicyortemplate>`__
    field, make sure both fields are compatible with each other.

    Attributes:
        cpu_milli (int):
            The milliCPU count.

            ``cpuMilli`` defines the amount of CPU resources per task in
            milliCPU units. For example, ``1000`` corresponds to 1 vCPU
            per task. If undefined, the default value is ``2000``.

            If you also define the VM's machine type using the
            ``machineType`` in
            `InstancePolicy <https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicy>`__
            field or inside the ``instanceTemplate`` in the
            `InstancePolicyOrTemplate <https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicyortemplate>`__
            field, make sure the CPU resources for both fields are
            compatible with each other and with how many tasks you want
            to allow to run on the same VM at the same time.

            For example, if you specify the ``n2-standard-2`` machine
            type, which has 2 vCPUs each, you are recommended to set
            ``cpuMilli`` no more than ``2000``, or you are recommended
            to run two tasks on the same VM if you set ``cpuMilli`` to
            ``1000`` or less.
        memory_mib (int):
            Memory in MiB.

            ``memoryMib`` defines the amount of memory per task in MiB
            units. If undefined, the default value is ``2000``. If you
            also define the VM's machine type using the ``machineType``
            in
            `InstancePolicy <https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicy>`__

            compatible with each other and with how many tasks you want
            to allow to run on the same VM at the same time.

            For example, if you specify the ``n2-standard-2`` machine
            type, which has 8 GiB each, you are recommended to set
            ``memoryMib`` to no more than ``8192``, or you are
            recommended to run two tasks on the same VM if you set
            ``memoryMib`` to ``4096`` or less.
        gpu_count (int):
            The GPU count.

            Not yet implemented.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        container (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.Runnable.Container):
            Container runnable.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``executable``.
        script (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.Runnable.Script):
            Script runnable.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``executable``.
        barrier (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.Runnable.Barrier):
            Barrier runnable.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``executable``.
        display_name (str):
            Optional. DisplayName is an optional field
            that can be provided by the caller. If provided,
            it will be used in logs and other outputs to
            identify the script, making it easier for users
            to understand the logs. If not provided the
            index of the runnable will be used for outputs.
        ignore_exit_status (bool):
            Normally, a runnable that returns a non-zero exit status
            fails and causes the task to fail. However, you can set this
            field to ``true`` to allow the task to continue executing
            its other runnables even if this runnable fails.
        background (bool):
            Normally, a runnable that doesn't exit causes its task to
            fail. However, you can set this field to ``true`` to
            configure a background runnable. Background runnables are
            allowed continue running in the background while the task
            executes subsequent runnables. For example, background
            runnables are useful for providing services to other
            runnables or providing debugging-support tools like SSH
            servers.

            Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically
            (if they have not already exited) a short time after all
            foreground runnables have completed. Even though this is
            likely to result in a non-zero exit status for the
            background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated
            as task failures.
        always_run (bool):
            By default, after a Runnable fails, no further Runnable are
            executed. This flag indicates that this Runnable must be run
            even if the Task has already failed. This is useful for
            Runnables that copy output files off of the VM or for
            debugging.

            The always_run flag does not override the Task's overall
            max_run_duration. If the max_run_duration has expired then
            no further Runnables will execute, not even always_run
            Runnables.
        environment (google.cloud.batch_v1alpha.types.Environment):
            Environment variables for this Runnable
            (overrides variables set for the whole Task or
            TaskGroup).

                Required for some container images. Overrides the ``CMD``
                specified in the container. If there is an ``ENTRYPOINT``
                (either in the container image or with the ``entrypoint``
                field below) then these commands are appended as arguments
                to the ``ENTRYPOINT``.

                Required for some container images. Overrides the
                ``ENTRYPOINT`` specified in the container.
            volumes (MutableSequence[str]):
                Volumes to mount (bind mount) from the host machine files or
                directories into the container, formatted to match
                ``--volume`` option for the ``docker run`` command—for
                example, ``/foo:/bar`` or ``/foo:/bar:ro``.

                If the ``TaskSpec.Volumes`` field is specified but this
                field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host
                machine to the container with the same mount path by
                default. In this case, the default mount option for
                containers will be read-only (``ro``) for existing
                persistent disks and read-write (``rw``) for other volume
                types, regardless of the original mount options specified in
                ``TaskSpec.Volumes``. If you need different mount settings,
                you can explicitly configure them in this field.
            options (str):
                Required for some container images. Arbitrary additional
                options to include in the ``docker run`` command when
                running this container—for example, ``--network host``. For
                the ``--volume`` option, use the ``volumes`` field for the
                container.
            block_external_network (bool):
                If set to true, external network access to and from
                container will be blocked, containers that are with
                block_external_network as true can still communicate with
                each other, network cannot be specified in the
                ``container.options`` field.
            username (str):
                Required if the container image is from a private Docker
                registry. The username to login to the Docker registry that
                contains the image.

                You can either specify the username directly by using plain
                text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret
                Manager secret: ``projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*``.
                However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced
                security.

                Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you
                risk the username being exposed to any users who can view
                the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret
                that contains the username instead.

                Learn more about `Secret
                Manager <https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/>`__

                registry. The password to login to the Docker registry that
                contains the image.

                For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an
                encrypted password by using a Secret Manager secret:
                ``projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*``.

                Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you
                risk the password being exposed to any users who can view
                the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret
                that contains the password instead.

            enable_image_streaming (bool):
                Optional. If set to true, this container runnable uses Image
                streaming.

                Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to initialize
                without waiting for the entire container image to download,
                which can significantly reduce startup time for large
                container images.

                When ``enableImageStreaming`` is set to true, the container
                runtime is `containerd <https://containerd.io/>`__ instead
                of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only
                supports the following ``container`` subfields:
                ``imageUri``, ``commands[]``, ``entrypoint``, and
                ``volumes[]``; any other ``container`` subfields are

            scripts, executable containers, and/or barriers) for each
            task in this task group to run. Each task runs this list of

            following conditions:

            -  The runnable exited with a zero status.
            -  The runnable didn't finish, but you enabled its
               ``background`` subfield.
            -  The runnable exited with a non-zero status, but you
               enabled its ``ignore_exit_status`` subfield.

            ComputeResource requirements.

            Maximum duration the task should run before being
            automatically retried (if enabled) or automatically failed.
            Format the value of this field as a time limit in seconds
            followed by ``s``—for example, ``3600s`` for 1 hour. The
            field accepts any value between 0 and the maximum listed for

        max_retry_count (int):
            Maximum number of retries on failures. The default, 0, which
            means never retry. The valid value range is [0, 10].

            the lifecycle policy condition is met, the action in the
            policy will execute. If task execution result does not meet
            with the defined lifecycle policy, we consider it as the
            default policy. Default policy means if the exit code is 0,
            exit task. If task ends with non-zero exit code, retry the
