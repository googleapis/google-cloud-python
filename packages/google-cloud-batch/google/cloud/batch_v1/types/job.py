                Mixing locations from different regions would cause errors.

                For example, the following are all valid URLs:

                -  Specify the image by its family name:

                Disk type as shown in ``gcloud compute disk-types list``.
                For example, local SSD uses type "local-ssd". Persistent
                disks and boot disks use "pd-balanced", "pd-extreme",
                "pd-ssd" or "pd-standard". If not specified, "pd-standard"
                will be used as the default type for non-boot disks,

                disks.
            size_gb (int):
                Disk size in GB.

                **Non-Boot Disk**: If the ``type`` specifies a persistent
                disk, this field is ignored if ``data_source`` is set as
                ``image`` or ``snapshot``. If the ``type`` specifies a local
                SSD, this field should be a multiple of 375 GB, otherwise,
                the final size will be the next greater multiple of 375 GB.

                **Boot Disk**: Batch will calculate the boot disk size based
                on source image and task requirements if you do not speicify
                the size. If both this field and the ``boot_disk_mib`` field
                in task spec's ``compute_resource`` are defined, Batch will
                only honor this field. Also, this field should be no smaller
                than the source disk's size when the ``data_source`` is set
                as ``snapshot`` or ``image``. For example, if you set an
                image as the ``data_source`` field and the image's default
                disk size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the

                creating the VMs for this job.

                Batch allows project-level SSH keys for a job's VMs only if

class TaskGroup(proto.Message):
    r"""A TaskGroup defines one or more Tasks that all share the same
    TaskSpec.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. TaskGroup name.
            The system generates this field based on parent
            Job name. For example:

            "projects/123456/locations/us-west1/jobs/job01/taskGroups/group01".
        task_spec (google.cloud.batch_v1.types.TaskSpec):
            Required. Tasks in the group share the same
            task spec.
        task_count (int):
            Number of Tasks in the TaskGroup.
            Default is 1.
        parallelism (int):
            Max number of tasks that can run in parallel. Default to
            min(task_count, parallel tasks per job limit). See: `Job
            Limits <https://cloud.google.com/batch/quotas#job_limits>`__.
            Field parallelism must be 1 if the scheduling_policy is
            IN_ORDER.
        scheduling_policy (google.cloud.batch_v1.types.TaskGroup.SchedulingPolicy):
            Scheduling policy for Tasks in the TaskGroup. The default
            value is AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE.
        task_environments (MutableSequence[google.cloud.batch_v1.types.Environment]):
            An array of environment variable mappings, which are passed
            to Tasks with matching indices. If task_environments is used
            then task_count should not be specified in the request (and
            will be ignored). Task count will be the length of
            task_environments.

            Tasks get a BATCH_TASK_INDEX and BATCH_TASK_COUNT
            environment variable, in addition to any environment
            variables set in task_environments, specifying the number of
            Tasks in the Task's parent TaskGroup, and the specific
            Task's index in the TaskGroup (0 through BATCH_TASK_COUNT -
            1).
        task_count_per_node (int):
            Max number of tasks that can be run on a VM
            at the same time. If not specified, the system
            will decide a value based on available compute
            resources on a VM and task requirements.
        require_hosts_file (bool):
            When true, Batch will populate a file with a list of all VMs
            assigned to the TaskGroup and set the BATCH_HOSTS_FILE
            environment variable to the path of that file. Defaults to
            false. The host file supports up to 1000 VMs.
        permissive_ssh (bool):
            When true, Batch will configure SSH to allow
            passwordless login between VMs running the Batch
            tasks in the same TaskGroup.
        run_as_non_root (bool):
            Optional. If not set or set to false, Batch uses the root
            user to execute runnables. If set to true, Batch runs the
            runnables using a non-root user. Currently, the non-root
            user Batch used is generated by OS Login. For more
            information, see `About OS
            Login <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin>`__.
