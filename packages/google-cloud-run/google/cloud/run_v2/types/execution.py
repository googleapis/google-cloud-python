        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Output only. Unstructured key value map that
            can be used to organize and categorize objects.
            User-provided labels are shared with Google's

            controller. It is not guaranteed to be set in
            happens-before order across separate operations.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Represents time when the
            execution started to run. It is not guaranteed

            separate operations.

            Output only. For a deleted resource, the
            deletion time. It is only populated as a
            response to a Delete request.
        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. For a deleted resource, the time
            after which it will be permamently deleted. It
            is only populated as a response to a Delete

                <p>Note that this value might not be what was used

                BETA.
        job (str):
            Output only. The name of the parent Job.
        parallelism (int):
            Output only. Specifies the maximum desired number of tasks
            the execution should run at any given time. Must be <=
            task_count. The actual number of tasks running in steady
            state will be less than this number when ((.spec.task_count
            - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism), i.e. when the
            work left to do is less than max parallelism.
        task_count (int):
            Output only. Specifies the desired number of
            tasks the execution should run. Setting to 1
            means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the
            success of that task signals the success of the
            execution.
        template (google.cloud.run_v2.types.TaskTemplate):
            Output only. The template used to create
            tasks for this execution.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Indicates whether the resource's reconciliation
            is still in progress. See comments in ``Job.reconciling``
            for additional information on reconciliation process in
            Cloud Run.
        conditions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition]):
            Output only. The Condition of this Execution,
            containing its readiness status, and detailed
            error information in case it did not reach the
            desired state.
        observed_generation (int):
            Output only. The generation of this Execution. See comments
            in ``reconciling`` for additional information on
            reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        running_count (int):
            Output only. The number of actively running
            tasks.
        succeeded_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which
            reached phase Succeeded.
        failed_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which
            reached phase Failed.
        cancelled_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which
            reached phase Cancelled.
        retried_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which have
            retried at least once.
        log_uri (str):
            Output only. URI where logs for this
            execution can be found in Cloud Console.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        etag (str):
            Output only. A system-generated fingerprint
            for this version of the resource. May be used to
            detect modification conflict during updates.
