        generation (int):

            increases every time the user modifies the
            desired state.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Output only. Unstructured key value map that
            can be used to organize and categorize objects.
            User-provided labels are shared with Google's
            billing system, so they can be used to filter,
            or break down billing charges by team,

            arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and
            should be preserved when modifying objects.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Represents time when the
            execution was acknowledged by the execution
            controller. It is not guaranteed to be set in
            happens-before order across separate operations.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Represents time when the
            execution started to run. It is not guaranteed
            to be set in happens-before order across
            separate operations.
        completion_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Represents time when the
            execution was completed. It is not guaranteed to
            be set in happens-before order across separate
            operations.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last-modified time.
        delete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. For a deleted resource, the
            deletion time. It is only populated as a
            response to a Delete request.
        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. For a deleted resource, the time
            after which it will be permamently deleted. It
            is only populated as a response to a Delete
            request.
        launch_stage (google.api.launch_stage_pb2.LaunchStage):
            The least stable launch stage needed to create this
            resource, as defined by `Google Cloud Platform Launch
            Stages <https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages>`__.
            Cloud Run supports ``ALPHA``, ``BETA``, and ``GA``.

            Note that this value might not be what was used as input.
            For example, if ALPHA was provided as input in the parent
            resource, but only BETA and GA-level features are were, this
            field will be BETA.
        job (str):
            Output only. The name of the parent Job.
        parallelism (int):
            Output only. Specifies the maximum desired number of tasks
            the execution should run at any given time. Must be <=
            task_count. The actual number of tasks running in steady
            state will be less than this number when ((.spec.task_count
            - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism), i.e. when the
            work left to do is less than max parallelism.
        task_count (int):
            Output only. Specifies the desired number of
            tasks the execution should run. Setting to 1
            means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the
            success of that task signals the success of the
            execution.
        template (google.cloud.run_v2.types.TaskTemplate):
            Output only. The template used to create
            tasks for this execution.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Indicates whether the resource's reconciliation
            is still in progress. See comments in ``Job.reconciling``
            for additional information on reconciliation process in
            Cloud Run.
        conditions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition]):
            Output only. The Condition of this Execution,
            containing its readiness status, and detailed
            error information in case it did not reach the
            desired state.
        observed_generation (int):
            Output only. The generation of this Execution. See comments
            in ``reconciling`` for additional information on
            reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        running_count (int):
            Output only. The number of actively running
            tasks.
        succeeded_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which
            reached phase Succeeded.
        failed_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which
            reached phase Failed.
        cancelled_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which
            reached phase Cancelled.
        retried_count (int):
            Output only. The number of tasks which have
            retried at least once.
        log_uri (str):
            Output only. URI where logs for this
            execution can be found in Cloud Console.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        etag (str):
            Output only. A system-generated fingerprint
            for this version of the resource. May be used to
            detect modification conflict during updates.
