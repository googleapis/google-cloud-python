            Stages <https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages>`__.
            Cloud Run supports ``ALPHA``, ``BETA``, and ``GA``. If no
            value is specified, GA is assumed. Set the launch stage to a
            preview stage on input to allow use of preview features in
            that stage. On read (or output), describes whether the

            feature.
        template (google.cloud.run_v2.types.ExecutionTemplate):
            Required. The template used to create
            executions for this Job.
        observed_generation (int):
            Output only. The generation of this Job. See comments in

            process in Cloud Run.
        terminal_condition (google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition):
            Output only. The Condition of this Job,
            containing its readiness status, and detailed
            error information in case it did not reach the
            desired state.
        conditions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition]):
            Output only. The Conditions of all other associated
            sub-resources. They contain additional diagnostics
            information in case the Job does not reach its desired
            state. See comments in ``reconciling`` for additional
            information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        execution_count (int):
            Output only. Number of executions created for
            this job.
        latest_created_execution (google.cloud.run_v2.types.ExecutionReference):
            Output only. Name of the last created
            execution.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Returns true if the Job is currently being
            acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.

            When a new Job is created, or an existing one is updated,
            Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to
            bring the Job to the desired state. This process is called
            reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process,
            ``observed_generation`` and ``latest_succeeded_execution``,
            will have transient values that might mismatch the intended
            state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is
            false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation
            succeeded and the state matches the Job, or there was an
            error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in
            ``terminal_condition.state``.

            If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will
            match: ``observed_generation`` and ``generation``,
            ``latest_succeeded_execution`` and
            ``latest_created_execution``.

            If reconciliation failed, ``observed_generation`` and
            ``latest_succeeded_execution`` will have the state of the
            last succeeded execution or empty for newly created Job.
            Additional information on the failure can be found in
            ``terminal_condition`` and ``conditions``.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        start_execution_token (str):
            A unique string used as a suffix creating a
            new execution. The Job will become ready when
            the execution is successfully started. The sum
            of job name and token length must be fewer than
            63 characters.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``create_execution``.
        run_execution_token (str):
            A unique string used as a suffix for creating
            a new execution. The Job will become ready when
            the execution is successfully completed. The sum
