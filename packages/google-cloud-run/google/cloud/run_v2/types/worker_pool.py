            Platform Launch
            Stages <https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages>`__.
            Cloud Run supports ``ALPHA``, ``BETA``, and ``GA``. If no

            For example, if ALPHA is provided as input, but only BETA
            and GA-level features are used, this field will be BETA on

        binary_authorization (google.cloud.run_v2.types.BinaryAuthorization):

            instance split is empty or not provided, defaults to 100%
            instances assigned to the latest ``Ready`` Revision.
        scaling (google.cloud.run_v2.types.WorkerPoolScaling):
            Optional. Specifies worker-pool-level scaling

            serving traffic. See comments in ``reconciling`` for
            additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
            Run. Please note that unlike v1, this is an int64 value. As
            with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a
            ``string`` instead of an ``integer``.
        terminal_condition (google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition):
            Output only. The Condition of this WorkerPool, containing
            its readiness status, and detailed error information in case
            it did not reach a serving state. See comments in
            ``reconciling`` for additional information on reconciliation
            process in Cloud Run.
        conditions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition]):
            Output only. The Conditions of all other associated
            sub-resources. They contain additional diagnostics
            information in case the WorkerPool does not reach its
            Serving state. See comments in ``reconciling`` for
            additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
            Run.
        latest_ready_revision (str):
            Output only. Name of the latest revision that is serving
            traffic. See comments in ``reconciling`` for additional
            information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        latest_created_revision (str):
            Output only. Name of the last created revision. See comments
            in ``reconciling`` for additional information on
            reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        instance_split_statuses (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.InstanceSplitStatus]):
            Output only. Detailed status information for corresponding
            instance splits. See comments in ``reconciling`` for
            additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
            Run.
        custom_audiences (MutableSequence[str]):
            One or more custom audiences that you want
            this worker pool to support. Specify each custom
            audience as the full URL in a string. The custom
            audiences are encoded in the token and used to
            authenticate requests. For more information, see
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/custom-audiences.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Returns true if the WorkerPool is currently
            being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired
            state.

            When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is
            updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary
            steps to bring the WorkerPool to the desired serving state.
            This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation
            is in process, ``observed_generation``,
            ``latest_ready_revison``, ``traffic_statuses``, and ``uri``
            will have transient values that might mismatch the intended
            state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is
            false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation
            succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or
            there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state
            can be found in ``terminal_condition.state``.

            If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will
            match: ``traffic`` and ``traffic_statuses``,
            ``observed_generation`` and ``generation``,
            ``latest_ready_revision`` and ``latest_created_revision``.

            If reconciliation failed, ``traffic_statuses``,
            ``observed_generation``, and ``latest_ready_revision`` will
            have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for
            newly created WorkerPools. Additional information on the
            failure can be found in ``terminal_condition`` and
            ``conditions``.
        etag (str):
            Output only. A system-generated fingerprint
            for this version of the resource. May be used to
            detect modification conflict during updates.
