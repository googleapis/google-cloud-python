        launch_stage (google.api.launch_stage_pb2.LaunchStage):

            Stages <https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages>`__.
            Cloud Run supports ``ALPHA``, ``BETA``, and ``GA``. If no
            value is specified, GA is assumed. Set the launch stage to a
            preview stage on input to allow use of preview features in
            that stage. On read (or output), describes whether the
            resource uses preview features.

            .. raw:: html

                <p>
                For example, if ALPHA is provided as input, but only BETA and GA-level

            collection of Revisions belonging to the Service. If traffic
            is empty or not provided, defaults to 100% traffic to the
            latest ``Ready`` Revision.
        scaling (google.cloud.run_v2.types.ServiceScaling):
            Optional. Specifies service-level scaling
            settings
        invoker_iam_disabled (bool):
            Optional. Disables IAM permission check for
            run.routes.invoke for callers of this service. This feature
            is available by invitation only. For more information, visit
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access#invoker_check.
        default_uri_disabled (bool):
            Optional. Disables public resolution of the
            default URI of this service.
        urls (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. All URLs serving traffic for
            this Service.
        custom_audiences (MutableSequence[str]):
            One or more custom audiences that you want
            this service to support. Specify each custom
            audience as the full URL in a string. The custom
            audiences are encoded in the token and used to

            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/custom-audiences.
        observed_generation (int):
            Output only. The generation of this Service currently
            serving traffic. See comments in ``reconciling`` for
            additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
            Run. Please note that unlike v1, this is an int64 value. As
            with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a
            ``string`` instead of an ``integer``.
        terminal_condition (google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition):
            Output only. The Condition of this Service, containing its
            readiness status, and detailed error information in case it
            did not reach a serving state. See comments in
            ``reconciling`` for additional information on reconciliation
            process in Cloud Run.
        conditions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Condition]):
            Output only. The Conditions of all other associated
            sub-resources. They contain additional diagnostics
            information in case the Service does not reach its Serving
            state. See comments in ``reconciling`` for additional
            information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        latest_ready_revision (str):
            Output only. Name of the latest revision that is serving
            traffic. See comments in ``reconciling`` for additional
            information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        latest_created_revision (str):
            Output only. Name of the last created revision. See comments
            in ``reconciling`` for additional information on
            reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        traffic_statuses (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.TrafficTargetStatus]):
            Output only. Detailed status information for corresponding
            traffic targets. See comments in ``reconciling`` for
            additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
            Run.
        uri (str):
            Output only. The main URI in which this
            Service is serving traffic.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. Returns true if the Service is currently being
            acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.

            When a new Service is created, or an existing one is
            updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary
            steps to bring the Service to the desired serving state.
            This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation
            is in process, ``observed_generation``,
            ``latest_ready_revison``, ``traffic_statuses``, and ``uri``
            will have transient values that might mismatch the intended
            state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is
            false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation
            succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or
            there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state
            can be found in ``terminal_condition.state``.

            If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will
            match: ``traffic`` and ``traffic_statuses``,
            ``observed_generation`` and ``generation``,
            ``latest_ready_revision`` and ``latest_created_revision``.

            If reconciliation failed, ``traffic_statuses``,
            ``observed_generation``, and ``latest_ready_revision`` will
            have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for
            newly created Services. Additional information on the
            failure can be found in ``terminal_condition`` and
            ``conditions``.
        etag (str):
            Output only. A system-generated fingerprint
            for this version of the resource. May be used to
            detect modification conflict during updates.
