class SubmitBuildRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request message for submitting a Build.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. The project and location to build in. Location
            must be a region, e.g., 'us-central1' or 'global' if the
            global builder is to be used. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}``
        storage_source (google.cloud.run_v2.types.StorageSource):
            Required. Source for the build.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        image_uri (str):
            Required. Artifact Registry URI to store the
            built image.
        buildpack_build (google.cloud.run_v2.types.SubmitBuildRequest.BuildpacksBuild):
            Build the source using Buildpacks.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``build_type``.
        docker_build (google.cloud.run_v2.types.SubmitBuildRequest.DockerBuild):
            Build the source using Docker. This means the
            source has a Dockerfile.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``build_type``.
        service_account (str):
            Optional. The service account to use for the
            build. If not set, the default Cloud Build
            service account for the project will be used.
        worker_pool (str):
            Optional. Name of the Cloud Build Custom Worker Pool that
            should be used to build the function. The format of this
            field is
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{region}/workerPools/{workerPool}``
            where ``{project}`` and ``{region}`` are the project id and
            region respectively where the worker pool is defined and
            ``{workerPool}`` is the short name of the worker pool.
        tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. Additional tags to annotate the
            build.

        Attributes:
            runtime (str):
                The runtime name, e.g. 'go113'. Leave blank
                for generic builds.
            function_target (str):
                Optional. Name of the function target if the
                source is a function source. Required for
                function builds.
            cache_image_uri (str):
                Optional. cache_image_uri is the GCR/AR URL where the cache
                image will be stored. cache_image_uri is optional and
                omitting it will disable caching. This URL must be stable
                across builds. It is used to derive a build-specific
                temporary URL by substituting the tag with the build ID. The
                build will clean up the temporary image on a best-effort
                basis.
            base_image (str):
                Optional. The base image used to opt into
                automatic base image updates.
            environment_variables (MutableMapping[str, str]):
                Optional. User-provided build-time
                environment variables.
            enable_automatic_updates (bool):
                Optional. Whether or not the application
                container will be enrolled in automatic base
                image updates. When true, the application will
                be built on a scratch base image, so the base
                layers can be appended at run time.
