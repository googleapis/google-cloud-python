    created from a template.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        containers (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Container]):
            Holds the single container that defines the
            unit of execution for this task.
        volumes (MutableSequence[google.cloud.run_v2.types.Volume]):
            Optional. A list of Volumes to make available
            to containers.
        max_retries (int):
            Number of retries allowed per Task, before
            marking this Task failed. Defaults to 3.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``retries``.
        timeout (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Optional. Max allowed time duration the Task
            may be active before the system will actively
            try to mark it failed and kill associated
            containers. This applies per attempt of a task,
            meaning each retry can run for the full timeout.
            Defaults to 600 seconds.
        service_account (str):
            Optional. Email address of the IAM service
            account associated with the Task of a Job. The
            service account represents the identity of the
            running task, and determines what permissions
            the task has. If not provided, the task will use
            the project's default service account.
        execution_environment (google.cloud.run_v2.types.ExecutionEnvironment):
            Optional. The execution environment being
            used to host this Task.
        encryption_key (str):
            A reference to a customer managed encryption
            key (CMEK) to use to encrypt this container
            image. For more information, go to
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/using-cmek
        vpc_access (google.cloud.run_v2.types.VpcAccess):
            Optional. VPC Access configuration to use for
            this Task. For more information, visit
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-vpc.
