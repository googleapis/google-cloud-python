class ServicesRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Services.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the ServicesRestTransport.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role.

                For some types of Google Cloud resources, a ``binding``
                can also specify a ``condition``, which is a logical
                expression that allows access to a resource only if the
                expression evaluates to ``true``. A condition can add
                constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                conditions in their IAM policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role.

                For some types of Google Cloud resources, a ``binding``
                can also specify a ``condition``, which is a logical
                expression that allows access to a resource only if the
                expression evaluates to ``true``. A condition can add
                constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                conditions in their IAM policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.
