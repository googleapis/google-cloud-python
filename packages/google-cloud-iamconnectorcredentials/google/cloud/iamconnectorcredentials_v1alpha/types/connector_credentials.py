    Attributes:
        token (str):
            The retrieved access token or credential for the end user.

            On MCPTool call, for an invalid token OAuth spec says this
            should return 401 or 403, but MCPServers may implement this
            differently. If you get any flavor of ``PERMISSION_DENIED``,
            retry your original request to RetrieveCredentials with
            [force_refresh][google.cloud.iamconnectorcredentials.v1alpha.RetrieveCredentialsRequest.force_refresh]
            set to ``true``, which will fetch a new token or initiate a
            new consent flow.
        header (str):
            The HTTP header name where the token should
            be placed.
        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The expiration time of the token.

            This does not guarantee that the token will be
            valid until this time, since the token could be
            revoked earlier.
            There could also be clock skew between the auth
            provider and the client so it may expire
            slightly earlier.
            If not set, the token might be permanent or it
            may be that the service does not (or cannot)
            know when it will expire.
        scopes (MutableSequence[str]):
            The scopes actually associated with the
            retrieved token.
            End users may have rejected some requested
            scopes, or the third-party authorization servers
            can return a different set of scopes than what
            was asked for. Callers should verify that all
