class PrivilegedAccessManagerGrpcTransport(PrivilegedAccessManagerTransport):
    """gRPC backend transport for PrivilegedAccessManager.

    This API allows customers to manage temporary, request based
    privileged access to their resources.

    It defines the following resource model:

    -  A collection of ``Entitlement`` resources. An entitlement allows
       configuring (among other things):

       -  Some kind of privileged access that users can request.
       -  A set of users called *requesters* who can request this
          access.
       -  A maximum duration for which the access can be requested.
       -  An optional approval workflow which must be satisfied before
          access is granted.

    -  A collection of ``Grant`` resources. A grant is a request by a
       requester to get the privileged access specified in an
       entitlement for some duration.

       After the approval workflow as specified in the entitlement is
       satisfied, the specified access is given to the requester. The
       access is automatically taken back after the requested duration
       is over.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
