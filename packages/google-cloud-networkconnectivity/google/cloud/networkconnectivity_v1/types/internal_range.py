class InternalRange(proto.Message):
    r"""The internal range resource for IPAM operations within a VPC
    network. Used to represent a private address range along with
    behavioral characteristics of that range (its usage and peering
    behavior). Networking resources can link to this range if they
    are created as belonging to it.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The name of an internal range. Format:
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/internalRanges/{internal_range}
            See:
            https://google.aip.dev/122#fields-representing-resource-names
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Time when the internal range was
            created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Time when the internal range was
            updated.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            User-defined labels.
        description (str):
            Optional. A description of this resource.
        ip_cidr_range (str):
            Optional. The IP range that this internal range defines.
            NOTE: IPv6 ranges are limited to usage=EXTERNAL_TO_VPC and
            peering=FOR_SELF. NOTE: For IPv6 Ranges this field is
            compulsory, i.e. the address range must be specified
            explicitly.
        network (str):
            Immutable. The URL or resource ID of the
            network in which to reserve the internal range.
            The network cannot be deleted if there are any
            reserved internal ranges referring to it. Legacy
            networks are not supported. For example:

            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network}
            projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network}
            {network}
        usage (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.InternalRange.Usage):
            Optional. The type of usage set for this
            InternalRange.
        peering (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.InternalRange.Peering):
            Optional. The type of peering set for this
            internal range.
        prefix_length (int):
            Optional. An alternate to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when
            trying to create an IPv4 reservation that automatically
            finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range
            and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range
            sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to
            change the range size. NOTE: For IPv6 this field only works
            if ip_cidr_range is set as well, and both fields must match.
            In other words, with IPv6 this field only works as a
            redundant parameter.
        target_cidr_range (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different
            address space while searching for a free range. If not set,
            defaults to the ["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12",
            "192.168.0.0/16"] address space (for auto-mode networks, the
            "10.0.0.0/9" range is used instead of "10.0.0.0/8"). This
            can be used to target the search in other rfc-1918 address
            spaces like "172.16.0.0/12" and "192.168.0.0/16" or
            non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC.
        users (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. The list of resources that refer
            to this internal range. Resources that use the
            internal range for their range allocation are
            referred to as users of the range. Other
            resources mark themselves as users while doing
            so by creating a reference to this internal
            range. Having a user, based on this reference,
            prevents deletion of the internal range referred
            to. Can be empty.
        overlaps (MutableSequence[google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.InternalRange.Overlap]):
            Optional. Types of resources that are allowed
            to overlap with the current internal range.
        migration (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.InternalRange.Migration):
            Optional. Must be present if usage is set to FOR_MIGRATION.
        immutable (bool):
            Optional. Immutable ranges cannot have their
            fields modified, except for labels and
            description.
        allocation_options (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.InternalRange.AllocationOptions):
            Optional. Range auto-allocation options, may be set only
            when auto-allocation is selected by not setting
            ip_cidr_range (and setting prefix_length).
        exclude_cidr_ranges (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. ExcludeCidrRanges flag. Specifies a
            set of CIDR blocks that allows exclusion of
            particular CIDR ranges from the auto-allocation
            process, without having to reserve these blocks
    """

    class Usage(proto.Enum):
        r"""Possible usage of an internal range.

        Values:
            USAGE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Unspecified usage is allowed in calls which
                identify the resource by other fields and do not
                need Usage set to complete. These are, i.e.:

                GetInternalRange and DeleteInternalRange.
                Usage needs to be specified explicitly in
                CreateInternalRange or UpdateInternalRange
                calls.
            FOR_VPC (1):
                A VPC resource can use the reserved CIDR block by
                associating it with the internal range resource if usage is
                set to FOR_VPC.
            EXTERNAL_TO_VPC (2):
                Ranges created with EXTERNAL_TO_VPC cannot be associated
                with VPC resources and are meant to block out address ranges
                for various use cases, like for example, usage on-prem, with
                dynamic route announcements via interconnect.
            FOR_MIGRATION (3):
                Ranges created FOR_MIGRATION can be used to lock a CIDR
                range between a source and target subnet. If usage is set to
                FOR_MIGRATION, the peering value has to be set to FOR_SELF
                or default to FOR_SELF when unset.

                If Peering is left unspecified in CreateInternalRange or
                UpdateInternalRange, it will be defaulted to FOR_SELF.
            FOR_SELF (1):
                This is the default behavior and represents
                the case that this internal range is intended to
                be used in the VPC in which it is created and is
                accessible from its peers. This implies that
                peers or peers-of-peers cannot use this range.
            FOR_PEER (2):
                This behavior can be set when the internal
                range is being reserved for usage by peers. This
                means that no resource within the VPC in which
                it is being created can use this to associate
                with a VPC resource, but one of the peers can.
                This represents donating a range for peers to
                use.
            NOT_SHARED (3):
                This behavior can be set when the internal range is being
                reserved for usage by the VPC in which it is created, but
                not shared with peers. In a sense, it is local to the VPC.
                This can be used to create internal ranges for various
                purposes like HTTP_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER or for
                Interconnect routes that are not shared with peers. This
                also implies that peers cannot use this range in a way that
                is visible to this VPC, but can re-use this range as long as
                it is NOT_SHARED from the peer VPC, too.

                unspefified means using the default strategy.
            RANDOM (1):
                Random strategy, the legacy algorithm, used
                for backwards compatibility. This allocation
                strategy remains efficient in the case of
                concurrent allocation requests in the same
                peered network space and doesn't require
                providing the level of concurrency in an
                explicit parameter, but it is prone to

                The N will be set in the first_available_ranges_lookup_size

            https://google.aip.dev/122#resource-id-segments Unique per
            location.
        internal_range (google.cloud.networkconnectivity_v1.types.InternalRange):
            Required. Initial values for a new internal
            range
        request_id (str):
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify
            requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if
            you must retry your request, the server will
            know to ignore the request if it has already
            been completed. The server will guarantee that
            for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
