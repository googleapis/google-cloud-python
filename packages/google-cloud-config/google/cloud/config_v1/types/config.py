            this flag is set to true, Infra Manager will
            instead attempt to automatically import the
            resource into the Terraform state (for supported
            resource types) and continue actuation.

            Not all resource types are supported, refer to

        tf_version (str):
            Output only. The current Terraform version
            set on the deployment. It is in the format of
            "Major.Minor.Patch", for example, "1.3.10".
        quota_validation (google.cloud.config_v1.types.QuotaValidation):

        page_size (int):
            When requesting a page of resources, 'page_size' specifies
            number of resources to return. If unspecified, at most 500
            will be returned. The maximum value is 1000.
        page_token (str):
            Token returned by previous call to
            'ListResources' which specifies the position in

            resources.
        filter (str):
            Lists the Resources that match the filter expression. A
            filter expression filters the resources listed in the

            {operator} {value}' where operators: '<', '>', '<=', '>=',
            '!=', '=', ':' are supported (colon ':' represents a HAS
            operator which is roughly synonymous with equality). {field}
            can refer to a proto or JSON field, or a synthetic field.
            Field names can be camelCase or snake_case.
