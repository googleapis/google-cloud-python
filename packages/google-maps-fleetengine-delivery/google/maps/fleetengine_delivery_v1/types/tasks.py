class Task(proto.Message):
    r"""A Task in the Delivery API represents a single action to track. In
    general, there is a distinction between shipment-related Tasks and
    break Tasks. A shipment can have multiple Tasks associated with it.
    For example, there could be one Task for the pickup, and one for the
    drop-off or transfer. Also, different Tasks for a given shipment can
    be handled by different vehicles. For example, one vehicle could
    handle the pickup, driving the shipment to the hub, while another
    vehicle drives the same shipment from the hub to the drop-off
    location.

    Note: gRPC and REST APIs use different field naming conventions. For
    example, the ``Task.journey_sharing_info`` field in the gRPC API and
    the ``Task.journeySharingInfo`` field in the REST API refer to the
    same field.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Must be in the format ``providers/{provider}/tasks/{task}``.
        type_ (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.Task.Type):
            Required. Immutable. Defines the type of the
            Task. For example, a break or shipment.
        state (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.Task.State):
            Required. The current execution state of the
            Task.
        task_outcome (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.Task.TaskOutcome):
            The outcome of the Task.
        task_outcome_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp that indicates when the ``Task``'s outcome was
            set by the provider.
        task_outcome_location (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.LocationInfo):
            The location where the ``Task``'s outcome was set. This
            value is updated as part of ``UpdateTask``. If this value
            isn't explicitly updated by the provider, then Fleet Engine
            populates it by default with the last known vehicle location
            (the *raw* location).
        task_outcome_location_source (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.Task.TaskOutcomeLocationSource):
            Indicates where the value of the ``task_outcome_location``
            came from.
        tracking_id (str):
            Immutable. This field facilitates the storing of an ID so
            you can avoid using a complicated mapping. You cannot set
            ``tracking_id`` for Tasks of type ``UNAVAILABLE`` and
            ``SCHEDULED_STOP``. These IDs are subject to the following
            restrictions:

            -  Must be a valid Unicode string.
            -  Limited to a maximum length of 64 characters.
            -  Normalized according to [Unicode Normalization Form C]
               (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/).
            -  May not contain any of the following ASCII characters:
               '/', ':', '?', ',', or '#'.
        delivery_vehicle_id (str):
            Output only. The ID of the vehicle that is executing this
            Task. Delivery Vehicle IDs are subject to the following
            restrictions:

            -  Must be a valid Unicode string.
            -  Limited to a maximum length of 64 characters.
            -  Normalized according to [Unicode Normalization Form C]
               (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/).
            -  May not contain any of the following ASCII characters:

        planned_location (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.LocationInfo):
            Immutable. The location where the Task will be completed.
            Optional for ``UNAVAILABLE`` Tasks, but required for all
            other Tasks.
        task_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Required. Immutable. The time needed to
            execute a Task at this location.
        target_time_window (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.TimeWindow):
            The time window during which the task should
            be completed.
        journey_sharing_info (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.Task.JourneySharingInfo):
            Output only. Journey sharing-specific fields. Not populated
            when state is ``CLOSED``.
        task_tracking_view_config (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.TaskTrackingViewConfig):
            The configuration for task tracking that
            specifies which data elements are visible to the
            end users under what circumstances.
        attributes (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.TaskAttribute]):
            A list of custom Task attributes. Each
            attribute must have a unique key.

            SCHEDULED_STOP (3):
                A scheduled stop Task is used for planning

                picking up or dropping off shipments from feeder
                vehicles or depots. It shouldn't be used for any
                shipments that are picked up or dropped off from
                an end customer.
            UNAVAILABLE (4):
