    API Overview

    Certificates Manager API allows customers to see and manage all
    their TLS certificates.

    Certificates Manager API service provides methods to manage
    certificates, group them into collections, and create serving
    configuration that can be easily applied to other Cloud resources
    e.g. Target Proxies.

    Data Model

    The Certificates Manager service exposes the following resources:

    -  ``Certificate`` that describes a single TLS certificate.
    -  ``CertificateMap`` that describes a collection of certificates
       that can be attached to a target resource.
    -  ``CertificateMapEntry`` that describes a single configuration
       entry that consists of a SNI and a group of certificates. It's a
       subresource of CertificateMap.

    Certificate, CertificateMap and CertificateMapEntry IDs have to
    fully match the regexp ``[a-z0-9-]{1,63}``. In other words,

    -  only lower case letters, digits, and hyphen are allowed
    -  length of the resource ID has to be in [1,63] range.

    Provides methods to manage Cloud Certificate Manager entities.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
