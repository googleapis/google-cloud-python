        headers (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The user can specify HTTP request headers to send with the
            job's HTTP request. This map contains the header field names
            and values. Repeated headers are not supported, but a header
            value can contain commas. These headers represent a subset
            of the headers that will accompany the job's HTTP request.
            Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced. A
            partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is
            below:

            -  Host: This will be computed by Cloud Scheduler and
               derived from
               [uri][google.cloud.scheduler.v1beta1.HttpTarget.uri].

               Scheduler.

               ``"Google-Cloud-Scheduler"``.
            -  ``X-Google-*``: Google internal use only.
            -  ``X-AppEngine-*``: Google internal use only.
            -  ``X-CloudScheduler``: This header will be set to true.
            -  ``X-CloudScheduler-JobName``: This header will contain
               the job name.
            -  ``X-CloudScheduler-ScheduleTime``: For Cloud Scheduler
               jobs specified in the unix-cron format, this header will
               contain the job schedule as an offset of UTC parsed
               according to RFC3339.

            The total size of headers must be less than 80KB.
        body (bytes):
            HTTP request body. A request body is allowed only if the
            HTTP method is POST, PUT, or PATCH. It is an error to set
            body on a job with an incompatible

            will be generated and attached as an ``Authorization``

            header in the HTTP request.

            This type of authorization can be used for many scenarios,
            including calling Cloud Run, or endpoints where you intend
            to validate the token yourself.

            allowed, and the maximum length allowed is 2083 characters.
        headers (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            HTTP request headers.

            This map contains the header field names and values. Headers
            can be set when the job is created.

            Cloud Scheduler sets some headers to default values:

            -  ``User-Agent``: By default, this header is
               ``"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"``.
               This header can be modified, but Cloud Scheduler will
               append
               ``"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"``
               to the modified ``User-Agent``.
            -  ``X-CloudScheduler``: This header will be set to true.
            -  ``X-CloudScheduler-JobName``: This header will contain
               the job name.
            -  ``X-CloudScheduler-ScheduleTime``: For Cloud Scheduler
               jobs specified in the unix-cron format, this header will
               contain the job schedule as an offset of UTC parsed
               according to RFC3339.

            If the job has an
            [body][google.cloud.scheduler.v1beta1.AppEngineHttpTarget.body],
            Cloud Scheduler sets the following headers:

            -  ``Content-Type``: By default, the ``Content-Type`` header
               is set to ``"application/octet-stream"``. The default can
               be overridden by explictly setting ``Content-Type`` to a
               particular media type when the job is created. For
               example, ``Content-Type`` can be set to
               ``"application/json"``.
            -  ``Content-Length``: This is computed by Cloud Scheduler.
               This value is output only. It cannot be changed.

            The headers below are output only. They cannot be set or
            overridden:

            -  ``X-Google-*``: For Google internal use only.
            -  ``X-AppEngine-*``: For Google internal use only.

            In addition, some App Engine headers, which contain
            job-specific information, are also be sent to the job
