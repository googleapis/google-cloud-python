Python Client for Web Risk
==========================

|stable| |pypi| |versions|

`Web Risk`_: is a Google Cloud service that lets client applications check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Unsafe web resources include social engineering sites—such as phishing and deceptive sites—and sites that host malware or unwanted software. With the Web Risk API, you can quickly identify known bad sites, warn users before they click infected links, and prevent users from posting links to known infected pages from your site. The Web Risk API includes data on more than a million unsafe URLs and stays up to date by examining billions of URLs each day.

3. `Enable the Web Risk.`_
4. `Set up Authentication.`_

.. _Select or create a Cloud Platform project.: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
.. _Enable billing for your project.: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project

.. _Set up Authentication.: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library in a virtual environment using `venv`_. `venv`_ is a tool that
creates isolated Python environments. These isolated environments can have separate
versions of Python packages, which allows you to isolate one project's dependencies
from the dependencies of other projects.

With `venv`_, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

.. _`venv`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
