        Returns a customized report of data access records. The report
        provides records of each time a user reads Google Analytics
        reporting data. Access records are retained for up to 2 years.

        Data Access Reports can be requested for a property. Reports may
        be requested for any property, but dimensions that aren't
        related to quota can only be requested on Google Analytics 360
        properties. This method is only available to Administrators.

        Explorations, GA4 Data API, and other products like Firebase &
        Admob that can retrieve data from Google Analytics through a
        linkage. These records don't include property configuration
        changes like adding a stream or changing a property's time zone.
        For configuration change history, see
