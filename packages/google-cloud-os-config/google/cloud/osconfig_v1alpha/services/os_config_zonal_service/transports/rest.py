class OsConfigZonalServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for OsConfigZonalService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the OsConfigZonalServiceRestTransport.

                    A Compute Engine VM can have multiple OS policy

                    You can use this API resource to determine both the
                    compliance state of your VM as well as the compliance
                    state of an individual OS policy.

                    OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to

                group of Compute Engine VM instances.

                An OS policy is used to define the desired state
                configuration for a Compute Engine VM instance through a
                set of configuration resources that provide capabilities
                such as installing or removing software packages, or
                executing a script.
