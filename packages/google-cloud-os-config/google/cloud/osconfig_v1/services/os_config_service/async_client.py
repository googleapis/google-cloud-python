                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                -  Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and
                   hyphens.
                -  Must start with a letter.
                -  Must be between 1-63 characters.
                -  Must end with a number or a letter.
                -  Must be unique within the project.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
