    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).

    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``mode``.
        percent (int):
            Specifies the relative value defined as a
            percentage, which will be multiplied by a
