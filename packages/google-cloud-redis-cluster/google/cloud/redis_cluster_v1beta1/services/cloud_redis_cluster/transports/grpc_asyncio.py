class CloudRedisClusterGrpcAsyncIOTransport(CloudRedisClusterTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for CloudRedisCluster.

    Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Redis clusters

    Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis Cluster

    The ``redis.googleapis.com`` service implements the Google Cloud
    Memorystore for Redis API and defines the following resource model
    for managing Redis clusters:

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:
       ``/projects/*``
    -  Each project has a collection of available locations, named:
       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of Redis clusters, named:
       ``/clusters/*``
    -  As such, Redis clusters are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/clusters/{instance_id}``

    Note that location_id must be a GCP ``region``; for example:

    -  ``projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/clusters/my-redis``

    We use API version selector for Flex APIs

    -  The versioning strategy is release-based versioning
    -  Our backend CLH only deals with the superset version (called
       v1main)
    -  Existing backend for Redis Gen1 and MRR is not touched.
    -  More details in go/redis-flex-api-versioning

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
