class CloudMemcacheRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for CloudMemcache.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the CloudMemcacheRestTransport.

    -  ``projects/my-memcached-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-memcached``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
