    r"""A Firestore query.

    The query stages are executed in the following order:

    Attributes:
        select (google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.StructuredQuery.Projection):
            Optional sub-set of the fields to return.

            This acts as a
            [DocumentMask][google.firestore.v1.DocumentMask] over the
            documents returned from a query. When not set, assumes that
            the caller wants all fields returned.
        from_ (MutableSequence[google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.StructuredQuery.CollectionSelector]):
            The collections to query.
        where (google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.StructuredQuery.Filter):
            The filter to apply.
        order_by (MutableSequence[google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.StructuredQuery.Order]):
            The order to apply to the query results.

            Firestore allows callers to provide a full ordering, a
            partial ordering, or no ordering at all. In all cases,
            Firestore guarantees a stable ordering through the following
            rules:

            -  The ``order_by`` is required to reference all fields used
               with an inequality filter.
            -  All fields that are required to be in the ``order_by``
               but are not already present are appended in
               lexicographical ordering of the field name.
            -  If an order on ``__name__`` is not specified, it is
               appended by default.

            Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last
            order specified, or 'ASCENDING' if no order was specified.
            For example:

            -  ``ORDER BY a`` becomes ``ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC``
            -  ``ORDER BY a DESC`` becomes
               ``ORDER BY a DESC, __name__ DESC``
            -  ``WHERE a > 1`` becomes
               ``WHERE a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC``
            -  ``WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1`` becomes
               ``WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC``
        start_at (google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.Cursor):
            A potential prefix of a position in the result set to start
            the query at.

            The ordering of the result set is based on the ``ORDER BY``
            clause of the original query.

            ::

               SELECT * FROM k WHERE a = 1 AND b > 2 ORDER BY b ASC, __name__ ASC;

            This query's results are ordered by
            ``(b ASC, __name__ ASC)``.

            Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix
            of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than
            what are in the provided ``ORDER BY``.

            Continuing off the example above, attaching the following
            start cursors will have varying impact:

            -  ``START BEFORE (2, /k/123)``: start the query right
               before ``a = 1 AND b > 2 AND __name__ > /k/123``.
            -  ``START AFTER (10)``: start the query right after
               ``a = 1 AND b > 10``.

            Unlike ``OFFSET`` which requires scanning over the first N
            results to skip, a start cursor allows the query to begin at
            a logical position. This position is not required to match
            an actual result, it will scan forward from this position to
            find the next document.

            Requires:

            -  The number of values cannot be greater than the number of
               fields specified in the ``ORDER BY`` clause.
        end_at (google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.Cursor):
            A potential prefix of a position in the result set to end
            the query at.

            This is similar to ``START_AT`` but with it controlling the
            end position rather than the start position.

            Requires:

            -  The number of values cannot be greater than the number of
               fields specified in the ``ORDER BY`` clause.
        offset (int):
            The number of documents to skip before returning the first
            result.

            This applies after the constraints specified by the
            ``WHERE``, ``START AT``, & ``END AT`` but before the
            ``LIMIT`` clause.

            Requires:

            -  The value must be greater than or equal to zero if
               specified.
        limit (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            The maximum number of results to return.

            Applies after all other constraints.

            Requires:

            -  The value must be greater than or equal to zero if
               specified.
        find_nearest (google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.StructuredQuery.FindNearest):
            Optional. A potential nearest neighbors
            search.
            Applies after all other filters and ordering.

            Finds the closest vector embeddings to the given
            query vector.
