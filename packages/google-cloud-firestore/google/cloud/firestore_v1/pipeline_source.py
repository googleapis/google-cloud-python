        """
        Returns documents from a fixed set of predefined document objects.

        Example:
            >>> from google.cloud.firestore_v1.pipeline_expressions import Constant
            >>> documents = [
            ...     {"name": "joe", "age": 10},
            ...     {"name": "bob", "age": 30},

            ...     .literals(*documents)
            ...     .where(field("age").lessThan(35))

            Output documents:
            ```json
            [
                {"name": "joe", "age": 10},
                {"name": "bob", "age": 30}
            ]
            ```

        Behavior:
            The `literals(...)` stage can only be used as the first stage in a pipeline (or
            sub-pipeline). The order of documents returned from the `literals` matches the
            order in which they are defined.

            While literal values are the most common, it is also possible to pass in
            expressions, which will be evaluated and returned, making it possible to test
            out different query / expression behavior without first needing to create some
            test data.

            For example, the following shows how to quickly test out the `length(...)`
            function on some constant test sets:

        Example:
            >>> from google.cloud.firestore_v1.pipeline_expressions import Constant
            >>> documents = [
            ...     {"x": Constant.of("foo-bar-baz").char_length()},
            ...     {"x": Constant.of("bar").char_length()}
            ... ]
            >>> pipeline = client.pipeline().literals(*documents)

            Output documents:
            ```json
            [
                {"x": 11},
                {"x": 3}
            ]
            ```

        Args:
            *documents: One or more documents to be returned by this stage. Each can be a `dict`
                       of values of `Expression` or `CONSTANT_TYPE` types.
        Returns:
            A new Pipeline object with this stage appended to the stage list.
        """
        return self._create_pipeline(stages.Literals(*documents))

    def subcollection(self, path: str) -> PipelineType:
        """
        Creates a new Pipeline targeted at a subcollection relative to the current document context.

        This is used inside stages like `addFields` to query physically nested subcollections
        without manually joining on IDs.

        Example:
            >>> db.pipeline().collection("books").add_fields(
            ...     db.pipeline().subcollection("reviews")
