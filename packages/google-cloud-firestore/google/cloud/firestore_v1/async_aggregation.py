"""Classes for representing Async aggregation queries for the Google Cloud Firestore API.

A :class:`~google.cloud.firestore_v1.async_aggregation.AsyncAggregationQuery` can be created directly from
a :class:`~google.cloud.firestore_v1.async_collection.AsyncCollection` and that can be
a more common way to create an aggregation query than direct usage of the constructor.
