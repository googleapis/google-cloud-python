            of this name for composite indexes will be:
            ``projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/indexes/{composite_index_id}``

            collection ID.

            The API scope supported by this index.
        fields (MutableSequence[google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Index.IndexField]):
            The fields supported by this index.

            For composite indexes, this requires a minimum of 2 and a
            maximum of 100 fields. The last field entry is always for
            the field path ``__name__``. If, on creation, ``__name__``
            was not specified as the last field, it will be added
            automatically with the same direction as that of the last
            field defined. If the final field in a composite index is
            not directional, the ``__name__`` will be ordered ASCENDING
            (unless explicitly specified).

            For single field indexes, this will always be exactly one
            entry with a field path equal to the field path of the
            associated field.
        state (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Index.State):
            Output only. The serving state of the index.
        density (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Index.Density):

            index.
        multikey (bool):
            Optional. Whether the index is multikey. By default, the
            index is not multikey. For non-multikey indexes, none of the
            paths in the index definition reach or traverse an array,
            except via an explicit array index. For multikey indexes, at
            most one of the paths in the index definition reach or

        unique (bool):
            Optional. Whether it is an unique index.

            field(s) are unique across documents.

                An index entry will only exist if ALL fields are present in

                This is both the default and only allowed value for Standard
                Edition databases (for both Cloud Firestore ``ANY_API`` and
                Cloud Datastore ``DATASTORE_MODE_API``).

                Take for example the following document:

                ::

                   {
                     "__name__": "...",
                     "a": 1,
                     "b": 2,
                     "c": 3
                   }

                an index on ``(a ASC, b ASC, c ASC, __name__ ASC)`` will
                generate an index entry for this document since ``a``, 'b',
                ``c``, and ``__name__`` are all present but an index of
                ``(a ASC, d ASC, __name__ ASC)`` will not generate an index
                entry for this document since ``d`` is missing.

                This means that such indexes can only be used to serve a
                query when the query has either implicit or explicit
                requirements that all fields from the index are present.
            SPARSE_ANY (2):
                An index entry will exist if ANY field are present in the
                document.

                This is used as the definition of a sparse index for
                Enterprise Edition databases.

                Take for example the following document:

                ::

                   {
                     "__name__": "...",
                     "a": 1,
                     "b": 2,
                     "c": 3
                   }

                an index on ``(a ASC, d ASC)`` will generate an index entry
                for this document since ``a`` is present, and will fill in
                an ``unset`` value for ``d``. An index on ``(d ASC, e ASC)``
                will not generate any index entry as neither ``d`` nor ``e``
                are present.

                An index that contains ``__name__`` will generate an index
                entry for all documents since Firestore guarantees that all
                documents have a ``__name__`` field.
            DENSE (3):
                An index entry will exist regardless of if the fields are
                present or not.

                This is the default density for an Enterprise Edition
                database.

                The index will store ``unset`` values for fields that are
                not present in the document.
