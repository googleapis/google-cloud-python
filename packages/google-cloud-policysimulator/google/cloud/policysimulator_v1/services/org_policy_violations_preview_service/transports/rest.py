class OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceRestTransport.
