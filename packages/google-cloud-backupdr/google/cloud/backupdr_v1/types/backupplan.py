            frequency of 2 means jobs will run every 2 hours from start
            time till end time defined.

            This is required for ``recurrence_type``, ``HOURLY`` and is
            not applicable otherwise. A validation error will occur if a
            value is supplied and ``recurrence_type`` is not ``HOURLY``.

            Value of hourly frequency should be between 4 and 23.

            Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth
            limitation of 3GB/S for GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S
            while doing a restore. Given the amount of parallel backups
            and restore we are targeting, this will potentially take the
            backup time to mins and hours (in worst case scenario).
        days_of_week (MutableSequence[google.type.dayofweek_pb2.DayOfWeek]):
            Optional. Specifies days of week like, MONDAY or TUESDAY, on
