            fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the
            resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten
            if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask
            then the request will fail.

            Required. The resource being updated
        request_id (str):
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify
            requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if
            you must retry your request, the server will
            know to ignore the request if it has already
            been completed. The server will guarantee that
            for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
