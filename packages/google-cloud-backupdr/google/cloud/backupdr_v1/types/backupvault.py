        request_id (str):
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify
            requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if
            you must retry your request, the server will
            know to ignore the request if it has already
            been completed. The server will guarantee that
            for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported

            If an etag is provided and does not match the

            blocked.

            Optional. Only validate the request, but do
            not perform mutations. The default is 'false'.

            Optional. If true and the BackupVault is not

        ignore_backup_plan_references (bool):
            Optional. If set to true, backupvault
            deletion will proceed even if there are backup

            is 'false'.
