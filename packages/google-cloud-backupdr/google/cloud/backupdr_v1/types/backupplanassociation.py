            Required. The list of fields to update. Field mask is used
            to specify the fields to be overwritten in the
            BackupPlanAssociation resource by the update. The fields
            specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource,
            not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is
            in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then the
            request will fail. Currently
            backup_plan_association.backup_plan is the only supported
            field.
        request_id (str):
            Optional. An optional request ID to identify
            requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if
            you must retry your request, the server will
            know to ignore the request if it has already
            been completed. The server will guarantee that
            for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and t he request times out.
            If you make the request again with the same
            request ID, the server can check if original
            operation with the same request ID was received,
            and if so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
