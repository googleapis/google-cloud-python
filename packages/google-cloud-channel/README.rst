Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library in a virtual environment using `venv`_. `venv`_ is a tool that
creates isolated Python environments. These isolated environments can have separate
versions of Python packages, which allows you to isolate one project's dependencies
from the dependencies of other projects.

With `venv`_, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

.. _`venv`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
