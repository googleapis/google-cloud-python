class PagesRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Pages.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the PagesRestTransport.

                session are represented by pages.

                For each flow, you define many pages, where your
                combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the
                topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment,
                exactly one page is the current page, the current page
                is considered active, and the flow associated with that
                page is considered active. Every flow has a special
                start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the
                start page page becomes the current page. For each
                conversational turn, the current page will either stay
                the same or transition to another page.

                You configure each page to collect information from the
                end-user that is relevant for the conversational state
                represented by the page.

                    A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described
                and visualized as a state machine. The states of a CX
                session are represented by pages.

                For each flow, you define many pages, where your
                combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the
                topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment,
                exactly one page is the current page, the current page
                is considered active, and the flow associated with that
                page is considered active. Every flow has a special
                start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the
                start page page becomes the current page. For each
                conversational turn, the current page will either stay
                the same or transition to another page.

                You configure each page to collect information from the
                end-user that is relevant for the conversational state
                represented by the page.

                For more information, see the `Page

                    A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described
                and visualized as a state machine. The states of a CX
                session are represented by pages.

                For each flow, you define many pages, where your
                combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the
                topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment,
                exactly one page is the current page, the current page
                is considered active, and the flow associated with that
                page is considered active. Every flow has a special
                start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the
                start page page becomes the current page. For each
                conversational turn, the current page will either stay
                the same or transition to another page.

                You configure each page to collect information from the
                end-user that is relevant for the conversational state
                represented by the page.
