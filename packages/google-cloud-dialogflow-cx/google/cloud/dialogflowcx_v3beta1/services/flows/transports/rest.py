class FlowsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Flows.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the FlowsRestTransport.

                    Flows represents the conversation
                flows when you build your chatbot agent.
                A flow consists of many pages connected
                by the transition routes. Conversations
                always start with the built-in Start
                Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition
                routes can direct the conversation
                session from the current flow (parent
                flow) to another flow (sub flow). When
                the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow
                will bring the session back to the
                parent flow, where the sub flow is
                started.

                Usually, when a transition route is
                followed by a matched intent, the intent
                will be "consumed". This means the
                intent won't activate more transition
                routes. However, when the followed
                transition route moves the conversation
                session into a different flow, the
                matched intent can be carried over and
                to be consumed in the target flow.

                    Flows represents the conversation
                flows when you build your chatbot agent.
                A flow consists of many pages connected
                by the transition routes. Conversations
                always start with the built-in Start
                Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition
                routes can direct the conversation
                session from the current flow (parent
                flow) to another flow (sub flow). When
                the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow
                will bring the session back to the
                parent flow, where the sub flow is
                started.

                Usually, when a transition route is
                followed by a matched intent, the intent
                will be "consumed". This means the
                intent won't activate more transition
                routes. However, when the followed
                transition route moves the conversation
                session into a different flow, the
                matched intent can be carried over and
                to be consumed in the target flow.

                    Flows represents the conversation
                flows when you build your chatbot agent.
                A flow consists of many pages connected
                by the transition routes. Conversations
                always start with the built-in Start
                Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition
                routes can direct the conversation
                session from the current flow (parent
                flow) to another flow (sub flow). When
                the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow
                will bring the session back to the
                parent flow, where the sub flow is
                started.

                Usually, when a transition route is
                followed by a matched intent, the intent
                will be "consumed". This means the
                intent won't activate more transition
                routes. However, when the followed
                transition route moves the conversation
                session into a different flow, the
                matched intent can be carried over and
                to be consumed in the target flow.
