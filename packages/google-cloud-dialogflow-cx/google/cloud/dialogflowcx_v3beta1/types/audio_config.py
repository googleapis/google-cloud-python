            ```FLAC`` <https://xiph.org/flac/documentation.html>`__
            (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding
            because it is lossless (therefore recognition is not
            compromised) and requires only about half the bandwidth of
            ``LINEAR16``. ``FLAC`` stream encoding supports 16-bit and
            24-bit samples, however, not all fields in ``STREAMINFO``
            are supported.

            Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. ``sample_rate_hertz``

            Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a
            very low bitrate encoding is required, ``OGG_OPUS`` is
            highly preferred over Speex encoding. The
            `Speex <https://speex.org/>`__ encoding supported by
            Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in MIME
            type ``audio/x-speex-with-header-byte``. It is a variant of
            the RTP Speex encoding defined in `RFC
            5574 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574>`__. The stream is
            a sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block
            starts with a byte containing the length of the block, in
            bytes, followed by one or more frames of Speex data, padded
            to an integral number of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC
            5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced with a
            single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband
            is supported. ``sample_rate_hertz`` must be 16000.

    immediately get ready for receiving the responses for the current

    The barge-in handling requires the client to start streaming audio
    input as soon as it starts playing back the audio from the previous
    response. The playback is modeled into two phases:

    -  No barge-in phase: which goes first and during which speech
       detection should not be carried out.

    -  Barge-in phase: which follows the no barge-in phase and during
       which the API starts speech detection and may inform the client
       that an utterance has been detected. Note that no-speech event is
       not expected in this phase.

    The client provides this configuration in terms of the durations of
    those two phases. The durations are measured in terms of the audio
    length from the the start of the input audio.
