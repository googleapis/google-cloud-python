class ResponseMessage(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a response message that can be returned by a
    conversational agent.

    Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The
    approach is as follows:

    -  If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all
       OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the
       result is used for output audio synthesis.
    -  If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML,
       then the concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the
       result is treated as either text or SSML as appropriate. The
       agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML
       consistently throughout the bot design.
    -  Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the
       result is used for output audio synthesis.

    This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience
    scenarios, where the text displayed to the user may differ from what
    is heard.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        text (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.Text):
            Returns a text response.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        payload (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Struct):
            Returns a response containing a custom,
            platform-specific payload.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        conversation_success (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.ConversationSuccess):
            Indicates that the conversation succeeded.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        output_audio_text (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.OutputAudioText):
            A text or ssml response that is
            preferentially used for TTS output audio
            synthesis, as described in the comment on the
            ResponseMessage message.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        live_agent_handoff (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.LiveAgentHandoff):
            Hands off conversation to a human agent.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        end_interaction (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.EndInteraction):
            Output only. A signal that indicates the interaction with
            the Dialogflow agent has ended. This message is generated by
            Dialogflow only when the conversation reaches
            ``END_SESSION`` page. It is not supposed to be defined by
            the user.

            It's guaranteed that there is at most one such message in
            each response.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        play_audio (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.PlayAudio):
            Signal that the client should play an audio clip hosted at a
            client-specific URI. Dialogflow uses this to construct
            [mixed_audio][google.cloud.dialogflow.cx.v3beta1.ResponseMessage.mixed_audio].
            However, Dialogflow itself does not try to read or process
            the URI in any way.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        mixed_audio (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.MixedAudio):
            Output only. An audio response message composed of both the
            synthesized Dialogflow agent responses and responses defined
            via
            [play_audio][google.cloud.dialogflow.cx.v3beta1.ResponseMessage.play_audio].
            This message is generated by Dialogflow only and not
            supposed to be defined by the user.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        telephony_transfer_call (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.TelephonyTransferCall):
            A signal that the client should transfer the
            phone call connected to this agent to a
            third-party endpoint.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        knowledge_info_card (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ResponseMessage.KnowledgeInfoCard):
            Represents info card for knowledge answers,
            to be better rendered in Dialogflow Messenger.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        tool_call (google.cloud.dialogflowcx_v3beta1.types.ToolCall):
            Returns the definition of a tool call that
            should be executed by the client.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``message``.
        channel (str):
            The channel which the response is associated with. Clients
            can specify the channel via
            [QueryParameters.channel][google.cloud.dialogflow.cx.v3beta1.QueryParameters.channel],
            and only associated channel response will be returned.
