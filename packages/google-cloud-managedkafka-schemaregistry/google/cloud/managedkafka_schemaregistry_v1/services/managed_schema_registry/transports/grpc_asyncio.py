class ManagedSchemaRegistryGrpcAsyncIOTransport(ManagedSchemaRegistryTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for ManagedSchemaRegistry.

    SchemaRegistry is a service that allows users to manage schemas for
    their Kafka clusters. It provides APIs to register, list, and delete
    schemas, as well as to get the schema for a given schema id or a
    given version id under a subject, to update the global or
    subject-specific compatibility mode, and to check the compatibility
    of a schema against a subject or a version. The main resource
    hierarchy is as follows:

    - SchemaRegistry
    - SchemaRegistry/Context
    - SchemaRegistry/Context/Schema
    - SchemaRegistry/Context/Subject
    - SchemaRegistry/Context/Subject/Version
    - SchemaRegistry/Config
    - SchemaRegistry/Mode

    **SchemaRegistry** is the root resource to represent a schema
    registry instance. A customer can have multiple schema registry
    instances in a project.

    **Context** is a context resource that represents a group of
    schemas, subjects and versions. A schema registry instance can have
    multiple contexts and always has a 'default' context. Contexts are
    independent of each other. Context is optional and if not specified,
    it falls back to the 'default' context.

    **Schema** is a schema resource that represents a unique schema in a
    context of a schema registry instance. Each schema has a unique
    schema id, and can be referenced by a version of a subject.

    **Subject** refers to the name under which the schema is registered.
    A typical subject is the Kafka topic name. A schema registry
    instance can have multiple subjects.

    **Version** represents a version of a subject. A subject can have
    multiple versions. Creation of new version of a subject is guarded
    by the compatibility mode configured globally or for the subject
    specifically.

    **Config** represents a config at global level cross all registry
    instances or at subject level. Currently, only compatibility is
    supported in config.

    **Mode** represents the mode of a schema registry or a specific
    subject. Three modes are supported:

    - READONLY: The schema registry is in read-only mode, no write
      operations allowed..
    - READWRITE: The schema registry is in read-write mode, which allows
      limited write operations on the schema.
    - IMPORT: The schema registry is in import mode, which allows more
      editing operations on the schema for data importing purposes.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
