"""Provides a tasklet decorator and related helpers.

Tasklets are a way to write concurrently running functions without threads.
Tasklets are executed by an event loop and can suspend themselves blocking for
I/O or some other operation using a yield statement. The notion of a blocking
operation is abstracted into the Future class, but a tasklet may also yield an
RPC in order to wait for that RPC to complete.

The @tasklet decorator wraps generator function so that when it is called, a
Future is returned while the generator is executed by the event loop. Within
the tasklet, any yield of a Future waits for and returns the Future's result.
For example::

    @tasklet
    def foo():
        a = yield <some Future>
        b = yield <another Future>
        return a + b

    def main():
        f = foo()
        x = f.result()
        print x

Note that blocking until the Future's result is available using result() is
somewhat inefficient (though not vastly -- it is not busy-waiting). In most
cases such code should be rewritten as a tasklet instead::

    @tasklet
    def main_tasklet():
        f = foo()
        x = yield f
        print x

Calling a tasklet automatically schedules it with the event loop::

    def main():
        f = main_tasklet()
        eventloop.run()  # Run until no tasklets left to do
        f.done()  # Returns True
