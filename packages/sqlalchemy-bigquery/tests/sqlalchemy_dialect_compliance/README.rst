==================================
SQLAlchemy Dialog Compliance Tests
==================================

SQLAlchemy provides reusable tests that test that SQLAlchemy dialects
work properly. This directory applies these tests to the BigQuery
SQLAlchemy dialect.

These are "system" tests, meaning that they run against a real
BigQuery account. To run the tests, you need a BigQuery account with
empty `test_pybigquery_sqla` and `test_schema` schemas. You need to
have the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable set to
the path of a Google Cloud authentication file.
