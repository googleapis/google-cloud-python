            Optional. Whether to force the use of Connect
            Agent-based transport.
            This will return a configuration that uses
            Connect Agent as the underlying transport
            mechanism for cluster types that would otherwise
            have used a different transport. Requires that
            Connect Agent be installed on the cluster.

            setting it.

            used in the resulting configuration.

            the version (recommended).
        kubernetes_namespace (str):
            Optional. The namespace to use in the kubeconfig context.

            If this field is specified, the server will set the
            ``namespace`` field in kubeconfig context. If not specified,
            the ``namespace`` field is omitted.
        operating_system (google.cloud.gkeconnect.gateway_v1.types.GenerateCredentialsRequest.OperatingSystem):
