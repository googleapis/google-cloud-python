class Space(proto.Message):
    r"""A space in Google Chat. Spaces are conversations between two
    or more users or 1:1 messages between a user and a Chat app.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. Resource name of the space.

            Format: ``spaces/{space}``

            Where ``{space}`` represents the system-assigned ID for the
            space. You can obtain the space ID by calling the
            ```spaces.list()`` <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/list>`__
            method or from the space URL. For example, if the space URL
            is
            ``https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#chat/space/AAAAAAAAA``,
            the space ID is ``AAAAAAAAA``.
        type_ (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.Type):
            Output only. Deprecated: Use ``space_type`` instead. The
            type of a space.
        space_type (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.SpaceType):
            Optional. The type of space. Required when
            creating a space or updating the space type of a
            space. Output only for other usage.
        single_user_bot_dm (bool):
            Optional. Whether the space is a DM between a
            Chat app and a single human.
        threaded (bool):
            Output only. Deprecated: Use ``spaceThreadingState``
            instead. Whether messages are threaded in this space.
        display_name (str):
            Optional. The space's display name. Required when `creating
            a
            space <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/create>`__
            with a ``spaceType`` of ``SPACE``. If you receive the error
            message ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` when creating a space or updating
            the ``displayName``, try a different ``displayName``. An
            existing space within the Google Workspace organization
            might already use this display name.

            For direct messages, this field might be empty.

            Supports up to 128 characters.
        external_user_allowed (bool):
            Optional. Immutable. Whether this space permits any Google
            Chat user as a member. Input when creating a space in a
            Google Workspace organization. Omit this field when creating
            spaces in the following conditions:

            -  The authenticated user uses a consumer account (unmanaged
               user account). By default, a space created by a consumer
               account permits any Google Chat user.

            For existing spaces, this field is output only.
        space_threading_state (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.SpaceThreadingState):
            Output only. The threading state in the Chat
            space.
        space_details (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.SpaceDetails):

            messages and threads in this space.
        import_mode (bool):
            Optional. Whether this space is created in ``Import Mode``
            as part of a data migration into Google Workspace. While
            spaces are being imported, they aren't visible to users
            until the import is complete.

            Creating a space in ``Import Mode``\ requires `user
            authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user>`__.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. Immutable. For spaces created in Chat, the time
            the space was created. This field is output only, except
            when used in import mode spaces.

            For import mode spaces, set this field to the historical
            timestamp at which the space was created in the source in
            order to preserve the original creation time.

            Only populated in the output when ``spaceType`` is
            ``GROUP_CHAT`` or ``SPACE``.
        last_active_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp of the last message in
            the space.
        admin_installed (bool):
            Output only. For direct message (DM) spaces
            with a Chat app, whether the space was created
            by a Google Workspace administrator.
            Administrators can install and set up a direct
            message with a Chat app on behalf of users in
            their organization.

            To support admin install, your Chat app must
            feature direct messaging.
        membership_count (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.MembershipCount):
            Output only. The count of joined memberships grouped by
            member type. Populated when the ``space_type`` is ``SPACE``,
            ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` or ``GROUP_CHAT``.

            Optional. Specifies the `access
            setting <https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020>`__
            of the space. Only populated when the ``space_type`` is
            ``SPACE``.
        customer (str):
            Optional. Immutable. The customer id of the domain of the
            space. Required only when creating a space with `app
            authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app>`__
            and ``SpaceType`` is ``SPACE``, otherwise should not be set.

            In the format ``customers/{customer}``, where ``customer``
            is the ``id`` from the `Admin SDK customer
            resource <https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/customers>`__.
            Private apps can also use the ``customers/my_customer``
            alias to create the space in the same Google Workspace
            organization as the app.

            For DMs, this field isn't populated.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_customer``.
        space_uri (str):
            Output only. The URI for a user to access the

            input only when creating a space. If the field is not set, a
            collaboration space is created. After you create the space,
            settings are populated in the ``PermissionSettings`` field.

            Setting predefined permission settings supports:

            -  `App
               authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app>`__
               with `administrator
               approval <https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth>`__
               with the ``chat.app.spaces`` or
               ``chat.app.spaces.create`` scopes.

            -  `User
               authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user>`__

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``space_permission_settings``.
        permission_settings (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.PermissionSettings):
            Optional. Space permission settings for existing spaces.
            Input for updating exact space permission settings, where
            existing permission settings are replaced. Output lists
            current permission settings.

            Reading and updating permission settings supports:

            -  `App
               authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app>`__
               with `administrator
               approval <https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth>`__
               with the ``chat.app.spaces`` scope. Only populated and
               settable when the Chat app created the space.

            -  `User
               authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user>`__

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``space_permission_settings``.
        import_mode_expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time when the space will be automatically
            deleted by the system if it remains in import mode.

            Each space created in import mode must exit this mode before
            this expire time using ``spaces.completeImport``.

            This field is only populated for spaces that were created
            with import mode.

class SearchSpacesRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request to search for a list of spaces based on a query.

    Attributes:
        use_admin_access (bool):
            When ``true``, the method runs using the user's Google
            Workspace administrator privileges.

            The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator
            with the `manage chat and spaces conversations
            privilege <https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245>`__.

            Requires either the ``chat.admin.spaces.readonly`` or
            ``chat.admin.spaces`` `OAuth 2.0
            scope <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes>`__.

            This method currently only supports admin access, thus only
            ``true`` is accepted for this field.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of spaces to return. The
            service may return fewer than this value.

            If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned.

            The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value
            more than 1000, it's automatically changed to
            1000.
        page_token (str):
            A token, received from the previous search
            spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve
            the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided
            should match the call that provided the page
            token. Passing different values to the other
            parameters might lead to unexpected results.
        query (str):
            Required. A search query.

            You can search by using the following parameters:

            -  ``create_time``
            -  ``customer``
            -  ``display_name``
            -  ``external_user_allowed``
            -  ``last_active_time``
            -  ``space_history_state``
            -  ``space_type``

            ``create_time`` and ``last_active_time`` accept a timestamp
            in `RFC-3339 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339>`__
            format and the supported comparison operators are: ``=``,
            ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``.

            ``customer`` is required and is used to indicate which
            customer to fetch spaces from. ``customers/my_customer`` is
            the only supported value.

            ``display_name`` only accepts the ``HAS`` (``:``) operator.
            The text to match is first tokenized into tokens and each
            token is prefix-matched case-insensitively and independently
            as a substring anywhere in the space's ``display_name``. For
            example, ``Fun Eve`` matches ``Fun event`` or
            ``The evening was fun``, but not ``notFun event`` or
            ``even``.

            ``external_user_allowed`` accepts either ``true`` or
            ``false``.

            ``space_history_state`` only accepts values from the
            [``historyState``]
            (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#Space.HistoryState)
            field of a ``space`` resource.

            ``space_type`` is required and the only valid value is
            ``SPACE``.

            Across different fields, only ``AND`` operators are
            supported. A valid example is
            ``space_type = "SPACE" AND display_name:"Hello"`` and an
            invalid example is
            ``space_type = "SPACE" OR display_name:"Hello"``.

            Among the same field, ``space_type`` doesn't support ``AND``
            or ``OR`` operators. ``display_name``,
            'space_history_state', and 'external_user_allowed' only
            support ``OR`` operators. ``last_active_time`` and
            ``create_time`` support both ``AND`` and ``OR`` operators.
            ``AND`` can only be used to represent an interval, such as
            ``last_active_time < "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND last_active_time > "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"``.

            The following example queries are valid:

            ::

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE"

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND
               display_name:"Hello World"

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND
               (last_active_time < "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" OR last_active_time >
               "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00")

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND
               (display_name:"Hello World" OR display_name:"Fun event") AND
               (last_active_time > "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND last_active_time <
               "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00")

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND
               (create_time > "2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND create_time <
               "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00") AND (external_user_allowed = "true") AND
               (space_history_state = "HISTORY_ON" OR space_history_state = "HISTORY_OFF")
        order_by (str):
            Optional. How the list of spaces is ordered.

            Supported attributes to order by are:

            -  ``membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count`` —
               Denotes the count of human users that have directly
               joined a space.
            -  ``last_active_time`` — Denotes the time when last
               eligible item is added to any topic of this space.
            -  ``create_time`` — Denotes the time of the space creation.

            Valid ordering operation values are:

            -  ``ASC`` for ascending. Default value.

            -  ``DESC`` for descending.

            The supported syntax are:

            -  ``membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count DESC``
            -  ``membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count ASC``
            -  ``last_active_time DESC``
            -  ``last_active_time ASC``
            -  ``create_time DESC``
