            Format: ``spaces/{space}``
        type_ (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.Type):
            Output only. Deprecated: Use ``space_type`` instead. The
            type of a space.
        space_type (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.SpaceType):
            The type of space. Required when creating a
            space or updating the space type of a space.
            Output only for other usage.
        single_user_bot_dm (bool):
            Optional. Whether the space is a DM between a
            Chat app and a single human.
        threaded (bool):
            Output only. Deprecated: Use ``spaceThreadingState``
            instead. Whether messages are threaded in this space.
        display_name (str):
            The space's display name. Required when `creating a
            space <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/create>`__.
            If you receive the error message ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` when
            creating a space or updating the ``displayName``, try a
            different ``displayName``. An existing space within the
            Google Workspace organization might already use this display
            name.

            For direct messages, this field might be empty.

            Supports up to 128 characters.
        external_user_allowed (bool):
            Immutable. Whether this space permits any Google Chat user
            as a member. Input when creating a space in a Google
            Workspace organization. Omit this field when creating spaces
            in the following conditions:

            -  The authenticated user uses a consumer account (unmanaged
               user account). By default, a space created by a consumer
               account permits any Google Chat user.

            -  The space is used to [import data to Google Chat]
               (https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/import-data-overview)
               because import mode spaces must only permit members from
               the same Google Workspace organization. However, as part
               of the `Google Workspace Developer Preview
               Program <https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview>`__,
               import mode spaces can permit any Google Chat user so
               this field can then be set for import mode spaces.

            For existing spaces, this field is output only.
        space_threading_state (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.SpaceThreadingState):
            Output only. The threading state in the Chat
            space.
        space_details (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.SpaceDetails):
            Details about the space including description
            and rules.
        space_history_state (google.apps.chat_v1.types.HistoryState):
            The message history state for messages and
            threads in this space.
        import_mode (bool):
            Optional. Whether this space is created in ``Import Mode``
            as part of a data migration into Google Workspace. While
            spaces are being imported, they aren't visible to users
            until the import is complete.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. Immutable. For spaces created in Chat, the time
            the space was created. This field is output only, except
            when used in import mode spaces.

            For import mode spaces, set this field to the historical
            timestamp at which the space was created in the source in
            order to preserve the original creation time.

            Only populated in the output when ``spaceType`` is
            ``GROUP_CHAT`` or ``SPACE``.
        last_active_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp of the last message in
            the space.
        admin_installed (bool):
            Output only. For direct message (DM) spaces
            with a Chat app, whether the space was created
            by a Google Workspace administrator.
            Administrators can install and set up a direct
            message with a Chat app on behalf of users in
            their organization.

            To support admin install, your Chat app must
            feature direct messaging.
        membership_count (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.MembershipCount):
            Output only. The count of joined memberships grouped by
            member type. Populated when the ``space_type`` is ``SPACE``,
            ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` or ``GROUP_CHAT``.
        access_settings (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space.AccessSettings):
            Optional. Specifies the `access
            setting <https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020>`__
            of the space. Only populated when the ``space_type`` is

            scope <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes>`__.

            This method currently only supports admin access, thus only
            ``true`` is accepted for this field.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of spaces to return. The
            service may return fewer than this value.

            If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned.

            The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value
            more than 1000, it's automatically changed to
            1000.
        page_token (str):
            A token, received from the previous search
            spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve
            the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided
            should match the call that provided the page
            token. Passing different values to the other
            parameters might lead to unexpected results.
        query (str):
            Required. A search query.

            You can search by using the following parameters:

            -  ``create_time``
            -  ``customer``
            -  ``display_name``
            -  ``external_user_allowed``
            -  ``last_active_time``
            -  ``space_history_state``
            -  ``space_type``

            ``create_time`` and ``last_active_time`` accept a timestamp
            in `RFC-3339 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339>`__
            format and the supported comparison operators are: ``=``,
            ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``.

            ``customer`` is required and is used to indicate which
            customer to fetch spaces from. ``customers/my_customer`` is
            the only supported value.

            ``display_name`` only accepts the ``HAS`` (``:``) operator.
            The text to match is first tokenized into tokens and each
            token is prefix-matched case-insensitively and independently
            as a substring anywhere in the space's ``display_name``. For
            example, ``Fun Eve`` matches ``Fun event`` or
            ``The evening was fun``, but not ``notFun event`` or
            ``even``.

            ``external_user_allowed`` accepts either ``true`` or
            ``false``.

            ``space_history_state`` only accepts values from the
            [``historyState``]
            (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#Space.HistoryState)
            field of a ``space`` resource.

            ``space_type`` is required and the only valid value is
            ``SPACE``.

            Across different fields, only ``AND`` operators are
            supported. A valid example is
            ``space_type = "SPACE" AND display_name:"Hello"`` and an
            invalid example is
            ``space_type = "SPACE" OR display_name:"Hello"``.

            Among the same field, ``space_type`` doesn't support ``AND``
            or ``OR`` operators. ``display_name``,
            'space_history_state', and 'external_user_allowed' only
            support ``OR`` operators. ``last_active_time`` and
            ``create_time`` support both ``AND`` and ``OR`` operators.
            ``AND`` can only be used to represent an interval, such as
            ``last_active_time < "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND last_active_time > "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"``.

            The following example queries are valid:

            ::

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE"

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND
               display_name:"Hello World"

               customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND
               (display_name:"Hello World" OR display_name:"Fun event") AND

               (space_history_state = "HISTORY_ON" OR space_history_state = "HISTORY_OFF")
        order_by (str):
            Optional. How the list of spaces is ordered.

            Supported attributes to order by are:

            -  ``membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count`` —
               Denotes the count of human users that have directly
               joined a space.

               eligible item is added to any topic of this space.
            -  ``create_time`` — Denotes the time of the space creation.

            Valid ordering operation values are:

            -  ``ASC`` for ascending. Default value.

            -  ``DESC`` for descending.

            The supported syntax are:
