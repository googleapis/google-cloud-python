class User(proto.Message):
    r"""A user in Google Chat. When returned as an output from a request, if
    your Chat app `authenticates as a
    user <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user>`__,
    the output for a ``User`` resource only populates the user's
    ``name`` and ``type``.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Resource name for a Google Chat [user][google.chat.v1.User].

            Format: ``users/{user}``. ``users/app`` can be used as an
            alias for the calling app
            [bot][google.chat.v1.User.Type.BOT] user.

            For [human users][google.chat.v1.User.Type.HUMAN],
            ``{user}`` is the same user identifier as:

            -  the ``id`` for the
               `Person <https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people>`__
               in the People API. For example, ``users/123456789`` in
               Chat API represents the same person as the ``123456789``
               Person profile ID in People API.

            -  the ``id`` for a
               `user <https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users>`__
               in the Admin SDK Directory API.

            -  the user's email address can be used as an alias for
               ``{user}`` in API requests. For example, if the People
               API Person profile ID for ``user@example.com`` is
               ``123456789``, you can use ``users/user@example.com`` as
               an alias to reference ``users/123456789``. Only the
               canonical resource name (for example ``users/123456789``)
               will be returned from the API.
        display_name (str):
            Output only. The user's display name.
        domain_id (str):
            Unique identifier of the user's Google
            Workspace domain.
        type_ (google.apps.chat_v1.types.User.Type):
            User type.
        is_anonymous (bool):
            Output only. When ``true``, the user is deleted or their
            profile is not visible.
