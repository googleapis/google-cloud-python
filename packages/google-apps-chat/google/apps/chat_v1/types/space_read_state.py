            Required. The space read state and fields to update.

            Required. The field paths to update. Currently supported
            field paths:

            -  ``last_read_time``

            When the ``last_read_time`` is before the latest message
            create time, the space appears as unread in the UI.

            To mark the space as read, set ``last_read_time`` to any
            value later (larger) than the latest message create time.
            The ``last_read_time`` is coerced to match the latest
            message create time. Note that the space read state only
            affects the read state of messages that are visible in the
            space's top-level conversation. Replies in threads are
            unaffected by this timestamp, and instead rely on the thread
            read state.
