        Creates a space and adds specified users to it. The calling user
        is automatically added to the space, and shouldn't be specified
        as a membership in the request. For an example, see `Set up a
        space with initial
        members <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/set-up-spaces>`__.

        To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the
        appropriate ``membership.member.name``. To add a human user, use
        ``users/{user}``, where ``{user}`` can be the email address for
        the user. For users in the same Workspace organization
        ``{user}`` can also be the ``id`` for the person from the People
        API, or the ``id`` for the user in the Directory API. For
        example, if the People API Person profile ID for
        ``user@example.com`` is ``123456789``, you can add the user to
        the space by setting the ``membership.member.name`` to
        ``users/user@example.com`` or ``users/123456789``.

        To specify the Google groups to add, add memberships with the
        appropriate ``membership.group_member.name``. To add or invite a
        Google group, use ``groups/{group}``, where ``{group}`` is the
        ``id`` for the group from the Cloud Identity Groups API. For
        example, you can use `Cloud Identity Groups lookup
        API <https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup>`__
        to retrieve the ID ``123456789`` for group email
        ``group@example.com``, then you can add the group to the space
        by setting the ``membership.group_member.name`` to
        ``groups/123456789``. Group email is not supported, and Google
        groups can only be added as members in named spaces.

        For a named space or group chat, if the caller blocks, or is
        blocked by some members, or doesn't have permission to add some
        members, then those members aren't added to the created space.

        To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and
        another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent
        the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails
        and the DM isn't created.

        To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set
        ``Space.singleUserBotDm`` to ``true`` and don't specify any
        memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with
        the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space
        or an existing DM between two human users, see `Invite or add a
        user or app to a
        space <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members>`__.

        If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user
        blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the
        existing DM is returned.

        Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported. If you receive
        the error message ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` when setting up a space,
        try a different ``displayName``. An existing space within the

        To specify the member to add, set the ``membership.member.name``
        for the human or app member, or set the
        ``membership.group_member.name`` for the group member.

        -  To add the calling app to a space or a direct message between
           two human users, use ``users/app``. Unable to add other apps
           to the space.

           can be the email address for the user. For users in the same
           Workspace organization ``{user}`` can also be the ``id`` for
           the person from the People API, or the ``id`` for the user in
           the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person
           profile ID for ``user@example.com`` is ``123456789``, you can

           API <https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup>`__
           to retrieve the ID ``123456789`` for group email

        r"""Return a callable for the list space events method over gRPC.

        Lists events from a Google Chat space. For each event, the
        `payload <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.oneof_payload>`__
        contains the most recent version of the Chat resource. For
        example, if you list events about new space members, the server
        returns ``Membership`` resources that contain the latest
        membership details. If new members were removed during the
        requested period, the event payload contains an empty
        ``Membership`` resource.

        Requires `user
        authentication <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user>`__.
        To list events, the authenticated user must be a member of the
        space.

        For an example, see `List events from a Google Chat
        space <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-space-events>`__.

        Returns:
            Callable[[~.ListSpaceEventsRequest],
                    ~.ListSpaceEventsResponse]:
                A function that, when called, will call the underlying RPC
                on the server.
