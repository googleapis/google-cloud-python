            ``projects/my-project-123/locations/global/groups/my-group``

            In the group resource name, the ``group_id`` is a unique
            identifier for a particular error group. The identifier is
            derived from key parts of the error-log content and is
            treated as Service Data. For information about how Service
            Data is handled, see `Google Cloud Privacy
            Notice <https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice>`__.

            For a list of supported locations, see `Supported
            Regions <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/region-support>`__.
            ``global`` is the default when unspecified.
