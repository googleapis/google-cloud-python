    Attributes:
        header (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.RequestHeader):
            The standard Fleet Engine request header.
        parent (str):
            Required. Must be in the format ``providers/{provider}``.
            The provider must be the Project ID (for example,
            ``sample-cloud-project``) of the Google Cloud Project of
            which the service account making this call is a member.
        trip_id (str):
            Required. Unique Trip ID. Subject to the following
            restrictions:

            -  Must be a valid Unicode string.
            -  Limited to a maximum length of 64 characters.
            -  Normalized according to [Unicode Normalization Form C]
               (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/).
            -  May not contain any of the following ASCII characters:
               '/', ':', '?', ',', or '#'.
        trip (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.Trip):
            Required. Trip entity to create.

            When creating a Trip, the following fields are required:

            -  ``trip_type``
            -  ``pickup_point``

            The following fields are used if you provide them:

            -  ``number_of_passengers``
            -  ``vehicle_id``
            -  ``dropoff_point``
            -  ``intermediate_destinations``
            -  ``vehicle_waypoints``

            All other Trip fields are ignored. For example, all trips
            start with a ``trip_status`` of ``NEW`` even if you pass in
            a ``trip_status`` of ``CANCELED`` in the creation request.

            Only ``EXCLUSIVE`` trips support
            ``intermediate_destinations``.

            When ``vehicle_id`` is set for a shared trip, you must
            supply the list of ``Trip.vehicle_waypoints`` to specify the
            order of the remaining waypoints for the vehicle, otherwise
            the waypoint order will be undetermined.

            When you specify ``Trip.vehicle_waypoints``, the list must
            contain all the remaining waypoints of the vehicle's trips,
            with no extra waypoints. You must order these waypoints such
            that for a given trip, the pickup point is before
            intermediate destinations, and all intermediate destinations
            come before the drop-off point. An ``EXCLUSIVE`` trip's
            waypoints must not interleave with any other trips.

            The ``trip_id``, ``waypoint_type`` and ``location`` fields
            are used, and all other TripWaypoint fields in
            ``vehicle_waypoints`` are ignored.
