            Output only. Indicates the last time the

            Note: This field is intended only for use by the
            Driver SDK and Consumer SDK.
        current_route_segment_traffic (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.ConsumableTrafficPolyline):
            Output only. Indicates the traffic conditions along the
            ``current_route_segment`` when they're available.

            Note: This field is intended only for use by the Driver SDK
            and Consumer SDK.
        current_route_segment_traffic_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            ends.

            Output only. The remaining driving distance in the
            ``current_route_segment`` field. The value is unspecified if
            the trip is not assigned to a vehicle, or the trip is
            completed or cancelled.
        eta_to_first_waypoint (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The ETA to the next waypoint (the first entry
            in the ``remaining_waypoints`` field). The value is
            unspecified if the trip is not assigned to a vehicle, or the
            trip is inactive (completed or cancelled).
        remaining_time_to_first_waypoint (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Output only. The duration from when the Trip data is
            returned to the time in ``Trip.eta_to_first_waypoint``. The
            value is unspecified if the trip is not assigned to a
            vehicle, or the trip is inactive (completed or cancelled).
        remaining_waypoints_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Indicates the last time that
            ``remaining_waypoints`` was changed (a waypoint was added,
            removed, or changed).
        remaining_waypoints_route_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Indicates the last time the
            ``remaining_waypoints.path_to_waypoint`` and
            ``remaining_waypoints.traffic_to_waypoint`` were modified.
            Your client app should cache this value and pass it in
            ``GetTripRequest`` to ensure the paths and traffic for
            ``remaining_waypoints`` are only returned if updated.
        number_of_passengers (int):
            Immutable. Indicates the number of passengers on this trip
            and does not include the driver. A vehicle must have
            available capacity to be returned in a ``SearchVehicles``
            response.
        last_location (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleLocation):
            Output only. Indicates the last reported
            location of the vehicle along the route.
        last_location_snappable (bool):
            Output only. Indicates whether the vehicle's
            ``last_location`` can be snapped to the
            current_route_segment. False if ``last_location`` or
            ``current_route_segment`` doesn't exist. It is computed by
            Fleet Engine. Any update from clients will be ignored.
        view (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripView):
            The subset of Trip fields that are populated
            and how they should be interpreted.
