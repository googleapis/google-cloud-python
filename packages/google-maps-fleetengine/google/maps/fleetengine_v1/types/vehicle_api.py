            vehicles still transmitting their locations are

        vehicle_types (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.Vehicle.VehicleType]):
            Required. Restricts the search to vehicles with one of the
            specified types. At least one vehicle type must be
            specified. VehicleTypes with a category of ``UNKNOWN`` are
            not allowed.
        required_attributes (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleAttribute]):

            ``required_one_of_attributes``, and
            ``required_one_of_attribute_sets`` fields.

            ``required_attributes`` is a list;
            ``required_one_of_attributes`` uses a message which allows a
            list of lists. In combination, the two fields allow the
            composition of this expression:

            ::

               (required_attributes[0] AND required_attributes[1] AND ...)
               AND

               (required_one_of_attributes[1][0] OR required_one_of_attributes[1][1] OR
               ...)

            Restricts the search to only those vehicles with the
            specified attributes. This field is a conjunction/AND
            operation. A max of 50 required_attributes is allowed. This
            matches the maximum number of attributes allowed on a
            vehicle.
        required_one_of_attributes (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleAttributeList]):
            Restricts the search to only those vehicles with at least
            one of the specified attributes in each
            ``VehicleAttributeList``. Within each list, a vehicle must
            match at least one of the attributes. This field is an
            inclusive disjunction/OR operation in each
            ``VehicleAttributeList`` and a conjunction/AND operation
            across the collection of ``VehicleAttributeList``.
        required_one_of_attribute_sets (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleAttributeList]):
            ``required_one_of_attribute_sets`` provides additional
            functionality.

            Similar to ``required_one_of_attributes``,
            ``required_one_of_attribute_sets`` uses a message which
            allows a list of lists, allowing expressions such as this
            one:

            ::

               (required_attributes[0] AND required_attributes[1] AND ...)
               AND
               (
                 (required_one_of_attribute_sets[0][0] AND
                 required_one_of_attribute_sets[0][1] AND
                 ...)
                 OR
                 (required_one_of_attribute_sets[1][0] AND
                 required_one_of_attribute_sets[1][1] AND
                 ...)
               )

            Restricts the search to only those vehicles with all the
            attributes in a ``VehicleAttributeList``. Within each list,
            a vehicle must match all of the attributes. This field is a
            conjunction/AND operation in each ``VehicleAttributeList``
            and inclusive disjunction/OR operation across the collection
            of ``VehicleAttributeList``.
        order_by (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.SearchVehiclesRequest.VehicleMatchOrder):
            Required. Specifies the desired ordering
            criterion for results.
        include_back_to_back (bool):
            This indicates if vehicles with a single active trip are
            eligible for this search. This field is only used when
            ``current_trips_present`` is unspecified. When
            ``current_trips_present`` is unspecified and this field is
            ``false``, vehicles with assigned trips are excluded from
            the search results. When ``current_trips_present`` is
            unspecified and this field is ``true``, search results can
            include vehicles with one active trip that has a status of
            ``ENROUTE_TO_DROPOFF``. When ``current_trips_present`` is
            specified, this field cannot be set to true.

            The default value is ``false``.
        trip_id (str):
            Indicates the trip associated with this
            ``SearchVehicleRequest``.
        current_trips_present (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.SearchVehiclesRequest.CurrentTripsPresent):
            This indicates if vehicles with active trips are eligible
            for this search. This must be set to something other than
            ``CURRENT_TRIPS_PRESENT_UNSPECIFIED`` if ``trip_type``
            includes ``SHARED``.
        filter (str):
            Optional. A filter query to apply when searching vehicles.
            See http://aip.dev/160 for examples of the filter syntax.

            This field is designed to replace the
            ``required_attributes``, ``required_one_of_attributes``, and
            ``required_one_of_attributes_sets`` fields. If a non-empty
            value is specified here, the following fields must be empty:
            ``required_attributes``, ``required_one_of_attributes``, and
            ``required_one_of_attributes_sets``.

            This filter functions as an AND clause with other
            constraints, such as ``minimum_capacity`` or
            ``vehicle_types``.

            Note that the only queries supported are on vehicle
            attributes (for example, ``attributes.<key> = <value>`` or
            ``attributes.<key1> = <value1> AND attributes.<key2> = <value2>``).
            The maximum number of restrictions allowed in a filter query
            is 50.

            Also, all attributes are stored as strings, so the only
            supported comparisons against attributes are string
            comparisons. In order to compare against number or boolean
            values, the values must be explicitly quoted to be treated
            as strings (for example, ``attributes.<key> = "10"`` or
            ``attributes.<key> = "true"``).

            The standard Fleet Engine request header.
        parent (str):
            Required. Must be in the format ``providers/{provider}``.
            The provider must be the Project ID (for example,
            ``sample-cloud-project``) of the Google Cloud Project of
            which the service account making this call is a member.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of vehicles to return.
            Default value: 100.
        page_token (str):
            The value of the ``next_page_token`` provided by a previous
            call to ``ListVehicles`` so that you can paginate through
            groups of vehicles. The value is undefined if the filter
            criteria of the request is not the same as the filter
            criteria for the previous call to ``ListVehicles``.
        minimum_capacity (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            Specifies the required minimum capacity of the vehicle. All
            vehicles returned will have a ``maximum_capacity`` greater
            than or equal to this value. If set, must be greater or
            equal to 0.
        trip_types (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripType]):
            Restricts the response to vehicles that
            support at least one of the specified trip
            types.
        maximum_staleness (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Restricts the response to vehicles that have
            sent location updates to Fleet Engine within the
            specified duration. Stationary vehicles still
            transmitting their locations are not considered
            stale. If present, must be a valid positive
            duration.
        vehicle_type_categories (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.Vehicle.VehicleType.Category]):
            Required. Restricts the response to vehicles with one of the
            specified type categories. ``UNKNOWN`` is not allowed.
        required_attributes (MutableSequence[str]):
            Callers can form complex logical operations using any
            combination of the ``required_attributes``,
            ``required_one_of_attributes``, and
            ``required_one_of_attribute_sets`` fields.

            ``required_attributes`` is a list;
            ``required_one_of_attributes`` uses a message which allows a
            list of lists. In combination, the two fields allow the
            composition of this expression:

            ::

               (required_attributes[0] AND required_attributes[1] AND ...)
               AND
               (required_one_of_attributes[0][0] OR required_one_of_attributes[0][1] OR
               ...)
               AND
               (required_one_of_attributes[1][0] OR required_one_of_attributes[1][1] OR
               ...)

            Restricts the response to vehicles with the specified
            attributes. This field is a conjunction/AND operation. A max
            of 50 required_attributes is allowed. This matches the
            maximum number of attributes allowed on a vehicle. Each
            repeated string should be of the format "key:value".
        required_one_of_attributes (MutableSequence[str]):
            Restricts the response to vehicles with at least one of the
            specified attributes in each ``VehicleAttributeList``.
            Within each list, a vehicle must match at least one of the
            attributes. This field is an inclusive disjunction/OR
            operation in each ``VehicleAttributeList`` and a
            conjunction/AND operation across the collection of
            ``VehicleAttributeList``. Each repeated string should be of
            the format "key1:value1|key2:value2|key3:value3".
        required_one_of_attribute_sets (MutableSequence[str]):
            ``required_one_of_attribute_sets`` provides additional
            functionality.

            Similar to ``required_one_of_attributes``,
            ``required_one_of_attribute_sets`` uses a message which
            allows a list of lists, allowing expressions such as this
            one:

            ::

               (required_attributes[0] AND required_attributes[1] AND ...)
               AND
               (
                 (required_one_of_attribute_sets[0][0] AND
                 required_one_of_attribute_sets[0][1] AND
                 ...)
                 OR
                 (required_one_of_attribute_sets[1][0] AND
                 required_one_of_attribute_sets[1][1] AND
                 ...)
               )

            Restricts the response to vehicles that match all the
            attributes in a ``VehicleAttributeList``. Within each list,
            a vehicle must match all of the attributes. This field is a
            conjunction/AND operation in each ``VehicleAttributeList``
            and inclusive disjunction/OR operation across the collection
            of ``VehicleAttributeList``. Each repeated string should be
            of the format "key1:value1|key2:value2|key3:value3".
        vehicle_state (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleState):
            Restricts the response to vehicles that have
            this vehicle state.
        on_trip_only (bool):
            Only return the vehicles with current
            trip(s).
        filter (str):
            Optional. A filter query to apply when listing vehicles. See
            http://aip.dev/160 for examples of the filter syntax.

            This field is designed to replace the
            ``required_attributes``, ``required_one_of_attributes``, and
            ``required_one_of_attributes_sets`` fields. If a non-empty
            value is specified here, the following fields must be empty:
            ``required_attributes``, ``required_one_of_attributes``, and
            ``required_one_of_attributes_sets``.

            This filter functions as an AND clause with other
            constraints, such as ``vehicle_state`` or ``on_trip_only``.

            Note that the only queries supported are on vehicle
            attributes (for example, ``attributes.<key> = <value>`` or
            ``attributes.<key1> = <value1> AND attributes.<key2> = <value2>``).
            The maximum number of restrictions allowed in a filter query
            is 50.

            Also, all attributes are stored as strings, so the only
            supported comparisons against attributes are string
            comparisons. In order to compare against number or boolean
            values, the values must be explicitly quoted to be treated
            as strings (for example, ``attributes.<key> = "10"`` or
            ``attributes.<key> = "true"``).
        viewport (google.geo.type.types.Viewport):
            Optional. A filter that limits the vehicles
            returned to those whose last known location was
            in the rectangular area defined by the viewport.
