class OrgPolicyRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for OrgPolicy.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the OrgPolicyRestTransport.

    """REST backend synchronous transport for OrgPolicy.

    An interface for managing organization policies.

    The Organization Policy Service provides a simple mechanism for
    organizations to restrict the allowed configurations across
    their entire resource hierarchy.

    You can use a policy to configure restrictions on resources. For
    example, you can enforce a policy that restricts which Google
    Cloud APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
    hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a
    particular folder.

    Policies are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A
    policy applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all
    its child resources unless overridden with a policy lower in the
    hierarchy.

    A constraint defines an aspect of a resource's configuration
    that can be controlled by an organization's policy
    administrator. Policies are a collection of constraints that
    defines their allowable configuration on a particular resource
    and its child resources.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1
