class OrgPolicyAsyncClient:
    """An interface for managing organization policies.

    The Organization Policy Service provides a simple mechanism for
    organizations to restrict the allowed configurations across
    their entire resource hierarchy.

    You can use a policy to configure restrictions on resources. For
    example, you can enforce a policy that restricts which Google
    Cloud APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
    hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a
    particular folder.

    Policies are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A
    policy applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all
    its child resources unless overridden with a policy lower in the
    hierarchy.

    A constraint defines an aspect of a resource's configuration
    that can be controlled by an organization's policy
    administrator. Policies are a collection of constraints that
    defines their allowable configuration on a particular resource
    and its child resources.

                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and

                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is
