class PredictRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request message for Predict method.

    Attributes:
        placement (str):
            Required. Full resource name of the format:
            ``{placement=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/*}``
            or
            ``{placement=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/*}``.
            We recommend using the ``servingConfigs`` resource.
            ``placements`` is a legacy resource. The ID of the
            Recommendations AI serving config or placement. Before you
            can request predictions from your model, you must create at
            least one serving config or placement for it. For more
            information, see [Manage serving configs]
            (https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/manage-configs).

            The full list of available serving configs can be seen at
            https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/retail/catalogs/default_catalog/configs
        user_event (google.cloud.retail_v2alpha.types.UserEvent):
            Required. Context about the user, what they are looking at
            and what action they took to trigger the predict request.
            Note that this user event detail won't be ingested to
            userEvent logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write request is
            required for event logging.

            Don't set
            [UserEvent.visitor_id][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserEvent.visitor_id]
            or
            [UserInfo.user_id][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserInfo.user_id]
            to the same fixed ID for different users. If you are trying
            to receive non-personalized recommendations (not
            recommended; this can negatively impact model performance),
            instead set
            [UserEvent.visitor_id][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserEvent.visitor_id]
            to a random unique ID and leave
            [UserInfo.user_id][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserInfo.user_id]
            unset.
        page_size (int):
            Maximum number of results to return. Set this
            property to the number of prediction results
            needed. If zero, the service will choose a
            reasonable default. The maximum allowed value is
            100. Values above 100 will be coerced to 100.
        page_token (str):
            This field is not used; leave it unset.
        filter (str):
            Filter for restricting prediction results with a length
            limit of 5,000 characters. Accepts values for tags and the
            ``filterOutOfStockItems`` flag.

            -  Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to products that
               match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators ``OR``
               and ``NOT`` are supported if the expression is enclosed
               in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values
               by a space. ``-"tagA"`` is also supported and is
               equivalent to ``NOT "tagA"``. Tag values must be double
               quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1,000
               characters.

               Note: "Recently viewed" models don't support tag
               filtering at the moment.

            -  filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to products
               that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK.

            Examples:

            -  tag=("Red" OR "Blue") tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT
               "promotional")
            -  filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-"promotional")
            -  filterOutOfStockItems

            If your filter blocks all prediction results, the API will
            return *no* results. If instead you want empty result sets
            to return generic (unfiltered) popular products, set
            ``strictFiltering`` to False in ``PredictRequest.params``.
            Note that the API will never return items with storageStatus
            of "EXPIRED" or "DELETED" regardless of filter choices.

            If ``filterSyntaxV2`` is set to true under the ``params``
            field, then attribute-based expressions are expected instead
            of the above described tag-based syntax. Examples:

            -  (colors: ANY("Red", "Blue")) AND NOT (categories:
               ANY("Phones"))
            -  (availability: ANY("IN_STOCK")) AND (colors: ANY("Red")
               OR categories: ANY("Phones"))

            For more information, see `Filter
            recommendations <https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-recs>`__.
        validate_only (bool):
            Use validate only mode for this prediction
            query. If set to true, a dummy model will be
            used that returns arbitrary products. Note that
            the validate only mode should only be used for
            testing the API, or if the model is not ready.
        params (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Additional domain specific parameters for the predictions.

            Allowed values:

            -  ``returnProduct``: Boolean. If set to true, the
               associated product object will be returned in the
               ``results.metadata`` field in the prediction response.
            -  ``returnScore``: Boolean. If set to true, the prediction
               'score' corresponding to each returned product will be
               set in the ``results.metadata`` field in the prediction
               response. The given 'score' indicates the probability of
               a product being clicked/purchased given the user's
               context and history.
            -  ``strictFiltering``: Boolean. True by default. If set to
               false, the service will return generic (unfiltered)
               popular products instead of empty if your filter blocks
               all prediction results.
            -  ``priceRerankLevel``: String. Default empty. If set to be
               non-empty, then it needs to be one of
               {'no-price-reranking', 'low-price-reranking',
               'medium-price-reranking', 'high-price-reranking'}. This
               gives request-level control and adjusts prediction
               results based on product price.
            -  ``diversityLevel``: String. Default empty. If set to be
               non-empty, then it needs to be one of {'no-diversity',
               'low-diversity', 'medium-diversity', 'high-diversity',
               'auto-diversity'}. This gives request-level control and
               adjusts prediction results based on product category.
            -  ``filterSyntaxV2``: Boolean. False by default. If set to
               true, the ``filter`` field is interpreteted according to
               the new, attribute-based syntax.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The labels applied to a resource must meet the following
            requirements:

            -  Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum
               of 64.
            -  Each label must be a key-value pair.
            -  Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum
               length of 63 characters and cannot be empty. Values can
               be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters.
            -  Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters,
               numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All
               characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
               characters are allowed.
            -  The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you
               can use the same key with multiple resources.
            -  Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
               character.

            Document <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements>`__
