class CompleteQueryRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Autocomplete parameters.

    Attributes:
        catalog (str):
            Required. Catalog for which the completion is performed.

            Full resource name of catalog, such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog``.
        query (str):
            Required. The query used to generate
            suggestions.
            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        visitor_id (str):
            Required field. A unique identifier for tracking visitors.
            For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie,
            which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a
            single device. This unique identifier should not change if
            the visitor logs in or out of the website.

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.
        language_codes (MutableSequence[str]):
            Note that this field applies for ``user-data`` dataset only.
            For requests with ``cloud-retail`` dataset, setting this
            field has no effect.

            The language filters applied to the output suggestions. If
            set, it should contain the language of the query. If not
            set, suggestions are returned without considering language
            restrictions. This is the BCP-47 language code, such as
            "en-US" or "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Tags for
            Identifying
            Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__. The
            maximum number of language codes is 3.
        device_type (str):
            The device type context for completion suggestions. We
            recommend that you leave this field empty.

            It can apply different suggestions on different device
            types, e.g. ``DESKTOP``, ``MOBILE``. If it is empty, the
            suggestions are across all device types.

            Supported formats:

            -  ``UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE``

            -  ``DESKTOP``

            -  ``MOBILE``

            -  A customized string starts with ``OTHER_``, e.g.
               ``OTHER_IPHONE``.
        dataset (str):
            Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion.
            "user-data" will use the imported dataset through
            [CompletionService.ImportCompletionData][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.CompletionService.ImportCompletionData].
            "cloud-retail" will use the dataset generated by cloud
            retail based on user events. If leave empty, it will use the
            "user-data".

            Current supported values:

            -  user-data

            -  cloud-retail: This option requires enabling auto-learning
               function first. See
               `guidelines <https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/completion-overview#generated-completion-dataset>`__.
        max_suggestions (int):
            Completion max suggestions. If left unset or set to 0, then
            will fallback to the configured value
            [CompletionConfig.max_suggestions][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.CompletionConfig.max_suggestions].

            The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. If it is set
            higher, it will be capped by 20.
        enable_attribute_suggestions (bool):
            If true, attribute suggestions are enabled
            and provided in response.
            This field is only available for "cloud-retail"
            dataset.
        entity (str):
            The entity for customers who run multiple entities, domains,
            sites, or regions, for example, ``Google US``,
            ``Google Ads``, ``Waymo``, ``google.com``, ``youtube.com``,
            etc. If this is set, it must be an exact match with
            [UserEvent.entity][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserEvent.entity]
            to get per-entity autocomplete results.
