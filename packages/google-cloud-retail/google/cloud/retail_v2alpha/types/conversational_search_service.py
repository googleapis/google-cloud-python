    [ConversationalSearchService.ConversationalSearch][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.ConversationalSearchService.ConversationalSearch]
    method.

    Attributes:
        placement (str):
            Required. The resource name of the search engine placement,
            such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/default_search``
            or
            ``projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/default_serving_config``
            This field is used to identify the serving config name and
            the set of models that will be used to make the search.
        branch (str):
            Required. The branch resource name, such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0``.

            Use "default_branch" as the branch ID or leave this field
            empty, to search products under the default branch.
        query (str):
            Optional. Raw search query to be searched
            for.
            If this field is empty, the request is
            considered a category browsing request.
        page_categories (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The categories associated with a category page.
            Must be set for category navigation queries to achieve good
            search quality. The format should be the same as
            [UserEvent.page_categories][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserEvent.page_categories];

            To represent full path of category, use '>' sign to separate
            different hierarchies. If '>' is part of the category name,
            replace it with other character(s).

            Category pages include special pages such as sales or
            promotions. For instance, a special sale page may have the
            category hierarchy: "pageCategories" : ["Sales > 2017 Black
            Friday Deals"].
        conversation_id (str):
            Optional. This field specifies the conversation id, which
            maintains the state of the conversation between client side
            and server side. Use the value from the previous
            [ConversationalSearchResponse.conversation_id][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.ConversationalSearchResponse.conversation_id].
            For the initial request, this should be empty.
        search_params (google.cloud.retail_v2alpha.types.ConversationalSearchRequest.SearchParams):
            Optional. Search parameters.
        visitor_id (str):
            Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For
            example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie,
            which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a
            single device. This unique identifier should not change if
            the visitor logs in or out of the website.

            This should be the same identifier as
            [UserEvent.visitor_id][google.cloud.retail.v2alpha.UserEvent.visitor_id].

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.
        user_info (google.cloud.retail_v2alpha.types.UserInfo):
            Optional. User information.
        conversational_filtering_spec (google.cloud.retail_v2alpha.types.ConversationalSearchRequest.ConversationalFilteringSpec):
            Optional. This field specifies all
            conversational filtering related parameters.
        user_labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. The user labels applied to a resource must meet
            the following requirements:

            - Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum of
              64.
            - Each label must be a key-value pair.
            - Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum
              length of 63 characters and cannot be empty. Values can be
              empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters.
            - Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters,
              numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All
              characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international
              characters are allowed.
            - The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you
              can use the same key with multiple resources.
            - Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international
              character.
