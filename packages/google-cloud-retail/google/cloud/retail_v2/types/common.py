                Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0.

                Setting to 1.0 gives the item a big promotion. However, it

                significantly more relevant to the search query can still
                trump your heavily favored but irrelevant items.

                Setting to -1.0 gives the item a big demotion. However,
                results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The
                item will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high
                ranking, but it is not blocked out completely.

                Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting

            products_filter (str):
