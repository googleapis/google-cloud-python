class CompleteQueryRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Auto-complete parameters.
    Attributes:
        catalog (str):
            Required. Catalog for which the completion is performed.

            Full resource name of catalog, such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog``.
        query (str):
            Required. The query used to generate
            suggestions.
            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        visitor_id (str):
            A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this
            could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be
            able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This
            unique identifier should not change if the visitor logs in
            or out of the website.

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.
        language_codes (Sequence[str]):
            The list of languages of the query. This is the BCP-47
            language code, such as "en-US" or "sr-Latn". For more
            information, see `Tags for Identifying
            Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__.

            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. Only
            "en-US" is currently supported.
        device_type (str):
            The device type context for completion suggestions. It is
            useful to apply different suggestions on different device
            types, e.g. DESKTOP, MOBILE. If it is empty, the suggestions
            are across all device types.

            Supported formats:

            -  UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE

            -  DESKTOP

            -  MOBILE

            -  A customized string starts with OTHER\_, e.g.
               OTHER_IPHONE.
        dataset (str):
            Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion.
            "user-data" will use the imported dataset through
            [CompletionService.ImportCompletionData][google.cloud.retail.v2.CompletionService.ImportCompletionData].
            "cloud-retail" will use the dataset generated by cloud
            retail based on user events. If leave empty, it will use the
            "user-data".

            Current supported values:

            -  user-data

            -  cloud-retail This option is not automatically enabled.
               Before using cloud-retail, contact
               retail-search-support@google.com first.
        max_suggestions (int):
            Completion max suggestions.
            The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. The
            default value is 20.

            -  They are ordered from latest to oldest.
            -  They are matched with
               [CompleteQueryRequest.query][google.cloud.retail.v2.CompleteQueryRequest.query]
               case insensitively.
            -  They are transformed to lower cases.
            -  They are UTF-8 safe.

            Recent searches are deduplicated. More recent searches will
            be reserved when duplication happens.
