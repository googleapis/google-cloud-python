class UserEvent(proto.Message):
    r"""UserEvent captures all metadata information Retail API needs
    to know about how end users interact with customers' website.

    Attributes:
        event_type (str):
            Required. User event type. Allowed values are:

            -  ``add-to-cart``: Products being added to cart.
            -  ``remove-from-cart``: Products being removed from cart.
            -  ``category-page-view``: Special pages such as sale or
               promotion pages viewed.
            -  ``detail-page-view``: Products detail page viewed.
            -  ``home-page-view``: Homepage viewed.
            -  ``promotion-offered``: Promotion is offered to a user.
            -  ``promotion-not-offered``: Promotion is not offered to a
               user.
            -  ``purchase-complete``: User finishing a purchase.
            -  ``search``: Product search.
            -  ``shopping-cart-page-view``: User viewing a shopping
               cart.
        visitor_id (str):
            Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors.

            For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie,
            which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a
            single device. This unique identifier should not change if
            the visitor log in/out of the website.

            Don't set the field to the same fixed ID for different
            users. This mixes the event history of those users together,
            which results in degraded model quality.

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.

            The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend
            to use Google Analytics `Client
            ID <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId>`__
            for this field.
        session_id (str):
            A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a
            length limit of 128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an
            end user behavior in a time span.

            A general guideline to populate the sesion_id:

            1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id
               should be assigned.
            2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use
               uuid or add visitor_id as prefix.
        event_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Only required for
            [UserEventService.ImportUserEvents][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.UserEventService.ImportUserEvents]
            method. Timestamp of when the user event happened.
        experiment_ids (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of identifiers for the independent
            experiment groups this user event belongs to.
            This is used to distinguish between user events
            associated with different experiment setups
            (e.g. using Retail API, using different
            recommendation models).
        attribution_token (str):
            Highly recommended for user events that are the result of
            [PredictionService.Predict][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.PredictionService.Predict].
            This field enables accurate attribution of recommendation
            model performance.

            The value must be a valid
            [PredictResponse.attribution_token][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.PredictResponse.attribution_token]
            for user events that are the result of
            [PredictionService.Predict][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.PredictionService.Predict].
            The value must be a valid
            [SearchResponse.attribution_token][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.SearchResponse.attribution_token]
            for user events that are the result of
            [SearchService.Search][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.SearchService.Search].

            This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or
            purchase back to the event and the particular predict
            response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user
            clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass
            [PredictResponse.attribution_token][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.PredictResponse.attribution_token]
            as a URL parameter to product K's page. When recording
            events on product K's page, log the
            [PredictResponse.attribution_token][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.PredictResponse.attribution_token]
            to this field.
        product_details (MutableSequence[google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.ProductDetail]):
            The main product details related to the event.

            This field is optional except for the following event types:

            -  ``add-to-cart``
            -  ``detail-page-view``
            -  ``purchase-complete``

            In a ``search`` event, this field represents the products
            returned to the end user on the current page (the end user
            may have not finished browsing the whole page yet). When a
            new page is returned to the end user, after
            pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new
            ``search`` event with different
            [product_details][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.UserEvent.product_details]
            is desired. The end user may have not finished browsing the
            whole page yet.
        completion_detail (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.CompletionDetail):
            The main auto-completion details related to the event.

            This field should be set for ``search`` event when
            autocomplete function is enabled and the user clicks a
            suggestion for search.
        attributes (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.CustomAttribute]):
            Extra user event features to include in the recommendation
            model.

            If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events,
            also include them in the user events that you associate with
            prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be
            consistent between imported events and events provided with
            prediction requests. This lets the Retail API use those
            custom attributes when training models and serving
            predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality.

            This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an
            INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned:

            -  The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length
               limit of 5,000 characters.
            -  For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.
               Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8
               encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters.
            -  For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.

            For product recommendations, an example of extra user
            information is traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives
            at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the
            site directly, coming through Google search, or in other
            ways.
        cart_id (str):
            The ID or name of the associated shopping cart. This ID is
            used to associate multiple items added or present in the
            cart before purchase.

            This can only be set for ``add-to-cart``,
            ``purchase-complete``, or ``shopping-cart-page-view``
            events.
        purchase_transaction (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.PurchaseTransaction):
            A transaction represents the entire purchase transaction.

            Required for ``purchase-complete`` events. Other event types
            should not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned.
        search_query (str):
            The user's search query.

            See
            [SearchRequest.query][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.SearchRequest.query]
            for definition.

            The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 5,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.

            At least one of
            [search_query][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.UserEvent.search_query]
            or
            [page_categories][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.UserEvent.page_categories]
            is required for ``search`` events. Other event types should
            not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.
        filter (str):
            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for
            constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the
            products being filtered.

            See
            [SearchRequest.filter][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.SearchRequest.filter]
            for definition and syntax.

            The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.
        order_by (str):
            The order in which products are returned.

            See
            [SearchRequest.order_by][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.SearchRequest.order_by]
            for definition and syntax.

            The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.

            This can only be set for ``search`` events. Other event
            types should not set this field. Otherwise, an
            INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
        offset (int):
            An integer that specifies the current offset for pagination
            (the 0-indexed starting location, amongst the products
            deemed by the API as relevant).

            See
            [SearchRequest.offset][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.SearchRequest.offset]
            for definition.

            If this field is negative, an INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned.

            This can only be set for ``search`` events. Other event
            types should not set this field. Otherwise, an
            INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
        page_categories (MutableSequence[str]):
            The categories associated with a category page.

            To represent full path of category, use '>' sign to separate
            different hierarchies. If '>' is part of the category name,
            replace it with other character(s).

            Category pages include special pages such as sales or
            promotions. For instance, a special sale page may have the
            category hierarchy: "pageCategories" : ["Sales > 2017 Black
            Friday Deals"].

            Required for ``category-page-view`` events. At least one of
            [search_query][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.UserEvent.search_query]
            or
            [page_categories][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.UserEvent.page_categories]
            is required for ``search`` events. Other event types should
            not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
            returned.
        user_info (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.UserInfo):
            User information.
        uri (str):
            Complete URL (window.location.href) of the
            user's current page.
            When using the client side event reporting with
            JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this
            value is filled in automatically. Maximum length
            5,000 characters.
        referrer_uri (str):
            The referrer URL of the current page.

            When using the client side event reporting with
            JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this
            value is filled in automatically.
        page_view_id (str):
            A unique ID of a web page view.

            This should be kept the same for all user events triggered
            from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page
            view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing
            the page. The ``pageViewId`` property should be kept the
            same for all these events so that they can be grouped
            together properly.

            When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript
            pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in
            automatically.
        entity (str):
            The entity for customers that may run multiple different
            entities, domains, sites or regions, for example,
            ``Google US``, ``Google Ads``, ``Waymo``, ``google.com``,
            ``youtube.com``, etc. We recommend that you set this field
            to get better per-entity search, completion, and prediction
            results.
