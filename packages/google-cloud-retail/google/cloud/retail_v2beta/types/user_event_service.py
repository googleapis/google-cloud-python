            The URL including cgi-parameters but
            excluding the hash fragment with a length limit
            of 5,000 characters. This is often more useful

            The event timestamp in milliseconds. This
            prevents browser caching of otherwise identical
            get requests. The name is abbreviated to reduce
            the payload bytes.

            An arbitrary serialized JSON string that contains necessary
            information that can comprise a user event. When this field
            is specified, the user_event field will be ignored. Note:
