class Model(proto.Message):
    r"""Metadata that describes the training and serving parameters of a
    [Model][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.Model]. A
    [Model][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.Model] can be associated with a
    [ServingConfig][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.ServingConfig] and then
    queried through the Predict API.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The fully qualified resource name of the model.

            Format:
            ``projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/catalogs/{catalog_id}/models/{model_id}``
            catalog_id has char limit of 50. recommendation_model_id has
            char limit of 40.
        display_name (str):
            Required. The display name of the model.

            Should be human readable, used to display
            Recommendation Models in the Retail Cloud
            Console Dashboard. UTF-8 encoded string with
            limit of 1024 characters.
        training_state (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.Model.TrainingState):
            Optional. The training state that the model is in (e.g.
            ``TRAINING`` or ``PAUSED``).

            Since part of the cost of running the service is frequency
            of training - this can be used to determine when to train
            model in order to control cost. If not specified: the
            default value for ``CreateModel`` method is ``TRAINING``.
            The default value for ``UpdateModel`` method is to keep the
            state the same as before.
        serving_state (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.Model.ServingState):
            Output only. The serving state of the model: ``ACTIVE``,
            ``NOT_ACTIVE``.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp the Recommendation
            Model was created at.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp the Recommendation
            Model was last updated. E.g. if a Recommendation
            Model was paused - this would be the time the
            pause was initiated.
        type_ (str):
            Required. The type of model e.g. ``home-page``.

            Currently supported values: ``recommended-for-you``,
            ``others-you-may-like``, ``frequently-bought-together``,
            ``page-optimization``, ``similar-items``, ``buy-it-again``,
            ``on-sale-items``, and ``recently-viewed``\ (readonly
            value).

            This field together with
            [optimization_objective][google.cloud.retail.v2beta.Model.optimization_objective]
            describe model metadata to use to control model training and
            serving. See https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/models for
            more details on what the model metadata control and which
            combination of parameters are valid. For invalid
            combinations of parameters (e.g. type =
            ``frequently-bought-together`` and optimization_objective =
            ``ctr``), you receive an error 400 if you try to
            create/update a recommendation with this set of knobs.
        optimization_objective (str):
            Optional. The optimization objective e.g. ``cvr``.

            Currently supported values: ``ctr``, ``cvr``,
            ``revenue-per-order``.

            If not specified, we choose default based on model type.
            Default depends on type of recommendation:

            ``recommended-for-you`` => ``ctr``

            ``others-you-may-like`` => ``ctr``

            ``frequently-bought-together`` => ``revenue_per_order``

            create/update a recommendation with this set of knobs.
        periodic_tuning_state (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.Model.PeriodicTuningState):
            Optional. The state of periodic tuning.

            The period we use is 3 months - to do a one-off tune earlier
            use the ``TuneModel`` method. Default value is
            ``PERIODIC_TUNING_ENABLED``.
        last_tune_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the latest
            successful tune finished.
        tuning_operation (str):
            Output only. The tune operation associated
            with the model.
            Can be used to determine if there is an ongoing
            tune for this recommendation. Empty field
            implies no tune is goig on.
        data_state (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.Model.DataState):
            Output only. The state of data requirements for this model:
            ``DATA_OK`` and ``DATA_ERROR``.

            Recommendation model cannot be trained if the data is in
            ``DATA_ERROR`` state. Recommendation model can have
            ``DATA_ERROR`` state even if serving state is ``ACTIVE``:
            models were trained successfully before, but cannot be
            refreshed because model no longer has sufficient data for
            training.
        filtering_option (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.RecommendationsFilteringOption):
            Optional. If ``RECOMMENDATIONS_FILTERING_ENABLED``,
            recommendation filtering by attributes is enabled for the
            model.
        serving_config_lists (MutableSequence[google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.Model.ServingConfigList]):
            Output only. The list of valid serving
            configs associated with the
            PageOptimizationConfig.
        model_features_config (google.cloud.retail_v2beta.types.Model.ModelFeaturesConfig):
