class OrganizationRolloutsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for OrganizationRollouts.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the OrganizationRolloutsRestTransport.

             credentials (Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]): The
                 authorization credentials to attach to requests. These
                 credentials identify the application to the service; if none
                 are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the

                 removed in the next major version of this library.

                 ignored if ``channel`` is provided.
             client_cert_source_for_mtls (Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]): Client

                 if ``channel`` is provided.
             quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                 and quota.
             client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                 The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                 API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                 Generally, you only need to set this if you are developing
                 your own client library.
             always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                 be used for service account credentials.
             url_scheme: the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally
                 "https", but for testing or local servers,
                 "http" can be specified.
             interceptor (Optional[OrganizationRolloutsRestInterceptor]): Interceptor used
                 to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses.
             api_audience (Optional[str]): The intended audience for the API calls

                Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources:

                - `Global </compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalOperations>`__
                - `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations>`__
                - `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations>`__

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, readHandling API
                responses.

                Operations can be global, regional or zonal.

                ::

                   - For global operations, use the `globalOperations`
                   resource.
                   - For regional operations, use the
                   `regionOperations` resource.
                   - For zonal operations, use
                   the `zoneOperations` resource.

                For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal
                Resources.

                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
