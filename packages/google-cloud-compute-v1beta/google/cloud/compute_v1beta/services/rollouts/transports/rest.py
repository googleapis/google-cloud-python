class RolloutsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Rollouts.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the RolloutsRestTransport.

                Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources:

                - `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations>`__
                - `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations>`__

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, readHandling API
                responses.

                Operations can be global, regional or zonal.

                   - For global operations, use the `globalOperations`
                   resource.
