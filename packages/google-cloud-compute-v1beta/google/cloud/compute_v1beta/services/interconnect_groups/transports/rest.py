class InterconnectGroupsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for InterconnectGroups.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the InterconnectGroupsRestTransport.

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.

                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
                Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify a
                ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows
                access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to
                ``true``. A condition can add constraints based on
                attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

                **YAML example:**
                ``bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3``

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
                retention period.

                ~.compute.Policy:
                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
                Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify a
                ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows
                access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to
                ``true``. A condition can add constraints based on
                attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.
                **JSON example:**
                ``{ "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }``
                **YAML example:**
                ``bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3``
