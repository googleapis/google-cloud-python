class RegionDisksRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for RegionDisks.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the RegionDisksRestTransport.

                 authorization credentials to attach to requests. These
                 credentials identify the application to the service; if none
                 are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the
                 credentials from the environment.

             credentials_file (Optional[str]): Deprecated. A file with credentials that can
                 be loaded with :func:`google.auth.load_credentials_from_file`.
                 This argument is ignored if ``channel`` is provided. This argument will be
                 removed in the next major version of this library.
             scopes (Optional(Sequence[str])): A list of scopes. This argument is
                 ignored if ``channel`` is provided.
             client_cert_source_for_mtls (Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]): Client
                 certificate to configure mutual TLS HTTP channel. It is ignored
                 if ``channel`` is provided.
             quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                 and quota.
             client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                 The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                 API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                 Generally, you only need to set this if you are developing
                 your own client library.
             always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                 be used for service account credentials.
             url_scheme: the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally
                 "https", but for testing or local servers,
                 "http" can be specified.

                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
                Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify a
                ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows
                access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to
                ``true``. A condition can add constraints based on
                attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

                ``{ "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }``
                **YAML example:**
                ``bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3``

                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.

                    An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which
                specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A
                ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members``, or
                principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be user
                accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
                (such as G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of
                permissions; each ``role`` can be an IAM predefined role
                or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google
                Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify a
                ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows
                access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to
                ``true``. A condition can add constraints based on
                attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
                learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
                policies, see the `IAM
                documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.

                **YAML example:**
                ``bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3``

                responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                resource. - For regional operations, use the
                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
                use the ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more
                information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
                Note that completed Operation resources have a limited
