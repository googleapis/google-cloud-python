class InterconnectAttachmentsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for InterconnectAttachments.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the InterconnectAttachmentsRestTransport.

                 are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the
                 credentials from the environment.

                 Generally, you only need to set this if you are developing

             always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                 be used for service account credentials.
             url_scheme: the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally

                - For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``

                ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations,
