class AddressesRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Addresses.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the AddressesRestTransport.

             credentials_file (Optional[str]): A file with credentials that can
                 be loaded with :func:`google.auth.load_credentials_from_file`.
                 This argument is ignored if ``channel`` is provided.
             scopes (Optional(Sequence[str])): A list of scopes. This argument is
                 ignored if ``channel`` is provided.
             client_cert_source_for_mtls (Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]): Client
                 certificate to configure mutual TLS HTTP channel. It is ignored
                 if ``channel`` is provided.
             quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                 and quota.
             client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                 The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                 API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                 Generally, you only need to set this if you are developing
                 your own client library.
             always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                 be used for service account credentials.
             url_scheme: the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally
                 "https", but for testing or local servers,
                 "http" can be specified.
