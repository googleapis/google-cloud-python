class PublisherRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Publisher.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the PublisherRestTransport.

    Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and
    delivers them to a subscriber.

    An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
    product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.

    A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside
    of Google.

    A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated
    with Eventarc.

    A subscriber is a Google Cloud customer interested in receiving
    events.

    Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and
    managed by the subscriber in their Google Cloud project. A
    Channel represents a subscriber's intent to receive events from
    an event provider. A Channel is associated with exactly one
    event provider.

    ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that is
    created and managed by the partner in their Google Cloud
    project. A ChannelConnection represents a connection between a
    partner and a subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a
    one-to-one mapping with a Channel.

    Bus is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and
    managed in a Google Cloud project. A Bus provides a discoverable
    endpoint for events and is a router that receives all events
    published by event providers and delivers them to zero or more
    subscribers.

    Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to
    Eventarc.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.
