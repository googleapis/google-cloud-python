.. note::

   Because the BigQuery client uses the third-party :mod:`requests` library
   by default and the BigQuery-Storage client uses :mod:`grpcio` library,
   both are safe to share instances across threads.  In multiprocessing
   scenarios, the best practice is to create client instances *after*
   :class:`multiprocessing.Pool` or :class:`multiprocessing.Process` invokes
   :func:`os.fork`.
