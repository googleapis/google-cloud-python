This script will run after ``nox -s docfx`` is run. docfx is the api doc format used by 
google cloud. It is described here: https://github.com/googleapis/docuploader?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements-for-docfx-yaml-tarballs.

One of the file used by docfx is toc.yml which is used to generate the table of contents sidebar.
This script will patch file to create subfolders for each of the clients
