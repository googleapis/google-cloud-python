class RowFilter(proto.Message):
    r"""Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based
    on specified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row
    to include just the cells from columns matching a given regular
    expression, or might return all the cells of a row but not their
    values. More complicated filters can be composed out of these
    components to express requests such as, "within every column of a
    particular family, give just the two most recent cells which are
    older than timestamp X."

    There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and
    transformers), as well as two ways to compose simple filters into
    more complex ones (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:

    - True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells
      wholesale from the output row. An example of a true filter is the
      ``value_regex_filter``, which excludes cells whose values don't
      match the specified pattern. All regex true filters use RE2 syntax
      (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) in raw byte mode
      (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An important
      point to keep in mind is that ``RE2(.)`` is equivalent by default
      to ``RE2([^\n])``, meaning that it does not match newlines. When
      attempting to match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use
      the escape sequence ``\C``, which may need to be further escaped
      as ``\\C`` in your client language.

    - Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of
      its cells in the output, without excluding them completely.
      Currently, the only supported transformer is the
      ``strip_value_transformer``, which replaces every cell's value
      with the empty string.

    - Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
      RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.

    The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not exceed
    20480 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other (in
    Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        chain (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.RowFilter.Chain):
            Applies several RowFilters to the data in
            sequence, progressively narrowing the results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        interleave (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.RowFilter.Interleave):
            Applies several RowFilters to the data in
            parallel and combines the results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        condition (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.RowFilter.Condition):
            Applies one of two possible RowFilters to the
            data based on the output of a predicate
            RowFilter.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        sink (bool):
            ADVANCED USE ONLY. Hook for introspection into the
            RowFilter. Outputs all cells directly to the output of the
            read rather than to any parent filter. Consider the
            following example:

            Despite being excluded by the qualifier filter, a copy of
            every cell that reaches the sink is present in the final
            result.

            As with an
            [Interleave][google.bigtable.v2.RowFilter.Interleave],
            duplicate cells are possible, and appear in an unspecified
            mutual order. In this case we have a duplicate with column
            "A:B" and timestamp 2, because one copy passed through the
            all filter while the other was passed through the label and
            sink. Note that one copy has label "foo", while the other
            does not.

            Cannot be used within the ``predicate_filter``,
            ``true_filter``, or ``false_filter`` of a
            [Condition][google.bigtable.v2.RowFilter.Condition].

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        pass_all_filter (bool):
            Matches all cells, regardless of input. Functionally
            equivalent to leaving ``filter`` unset, but included for
            completeness.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        block_all_filter (bool):
            Does not match any cells, regardless of
            input. Useful for temporarily disabling just
            part of a filter.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        row_key_regex_filter (bytes):
            Matches only cells from rows whose keys satisfy the given
            RE2 regex. In other words, passes through the entire row
            when the key matches, and otherwise produces an empty row.
            Note that, since row keys can contain arbitrary bytes, the
            ``\C`` escape sequence must be used if a true wildcard is
            desired. The ``.`` character will not match the new line
            character ``\n``, which may be present in a binary key.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        row_sample_filter (float):
            Matches all cells from a row with probability
            p, and matches no cells from the row with
            probability 1-p.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        family_name_regex_filter (str):
            Matches only cells from columns whose families satisfy the
            given RE2 regex. For technical reasons, the regex must not
            contain the ``:`` character, even if it is not being used as
            a literal. Note that, since column families cannot contain
            the new line character ``\n``, it is sufficient to use ``.``
            as a full wildcard when matching column family names.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        column_qualifier_regex_filter (bytes):
            Matches only cells from columns whose qualifiers satisfy the
            given RE2 regex. Note that, since column qualifiers can
            contain arbitrary bytes, the ``\C`` escape sequence must be
            used if a true wildcard is desired. The ``.`` character will
            not match the new line character ``\n``, which may be
            present in a binary qualifier.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        column_range_filter (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.ColumnRange):
            Matches only cells from columns within the
            given range.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        timestamp_range_filter (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.TimestampRange):
            Matches only cells with timestamps within the
            given range.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        value_regex_filter (bytes):
            Matches only cells with values that satisfy the given
            regular expression. Note that, since cell values can contain
            arbitrary bytes, the ``\C`` escape sequence must be used if
            a true wildcard is desired. The ``.`` character will not
            match the new line character ``\n``, which may be present in
            a binary value.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        value_range_filter (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.ValueRange):
            Matches only cells with values that fall
            within the given range.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        cells_per_row_offset_filter (int):
            Skips the first N cells of each row, matching
            all subsequent cells. If duplicate cells are
            present, as is possible when using an
            Interleave, each copy of the cell is counted
            separately.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        cells_per_row_limit_filter (int):
            Matches only the first N cells of each row.
            If duplicate cells are present, as is possible
            when using an Interleave, each copy of the cell
            is counted separately.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        cells_per_column_limit_filter (int):
            Matches only the most recent N cells within each column. For
            example, if N=2, this filter would match column ``foo:bar``
            at timestamps 10 and 9, skip all earlier cells in
            ``foo:bar``, and then begin matching again in column
            ``foo:bar2``. If duplicate cells are present, as is possible
            when using an Interleave, each copy of the cell is counted
            separately.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        strip_value_transformer (bool):
            Replaces each cell's value with the empty
            string.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        apply_label_transformer (str):
            Applies the given label to all cells in the output row. This
            allows the client to determine which results were produced
            from which part of the filter.

            Values must be at most 15 characters in length, and match
            the RE2 pattern ``[a-z0-9\\-]+``

            Due to a technical limitation, it is not currently possible
            to apply multiple labels to a cell. As a result, a Chain may
            have no more than one sub-filter which contains a
            ``apply_label_transformer``. It is okay for an Interleave to
            contain multiple ``apply_label_transformers``, as they will
            be applied to separate copies of the input. This may be
            relaxed in the future.

    Attributes:
        proto_rows_batch (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.ProtoRowsBatch):
            Partial rows in serialized ProtoRows format.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``partial_rows``.
        batch_checksum (int):
            CRC32C checksum of concatenated ``partial_rows`` data for
            the current batch.

            When present, the buffered data from ``partial_rows`` forms
            a complete parseable message of the appropriate type.

            The client should mark the end of a parseable message and
            prepare to receive a new one starting from the next
            ``PartialResultSet`` message. Clients must verify the
            checksum of the serialized batch before yielding it to the
            caller.

            This does NOT mean the values can be yielded to the callers
            since a ``resume_token`` is required to safely do so.

            If ``resume_token`` is non-empty and any data has been
            received since the last one, this field is guaranteed to be
            non-empty. In other words, clients may assume that a batch
            will never cross a ``resume_token`` boundary.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_batch_checksum``.
        resume_token (bytes):
            An opaque token sent by the server to allow query resumption
            and signal that the buffered values constructed from
            received ``partial_rows`` can be yielded to the caller.
            Clients can provide this token in a subsequent request to
            resume the result stream from the current point.

            When ``resume_token`` is non-empty, the buffered values
            received from ``partial_rows`` since the last non-empty
            ``resume_token`` can be yielded to the callers, provided
            that the client keeps the value of ``resume_token`` and uses
            it on subsequent retries.

            A ``resume_token`` may be sent without information in
            ``partial_rows`` to checkpoint the progress of a sparse
            query. Any previous ``partial_rows`` data should still be
            yielded in this case, and the new ``resume_token`` should be
            saved for future retries as normal.

            A ``resume_token`` will only be sent on a boundary where
            there is either no ongoing result batch, or
            ``batch_checksum`` is also populated.

            The server will also send a sentinel ``resume_token`` when
            last batch of ``partial_rows`` is sent. If the client
            retries the ExecuteQueryRequest with the sentinel
            ``resume_token``, the server will emit it again without any
            data in ``partial_rows``, then return OK.
        reset (bool):
            If ``true``, any data buffered since the last non-empty
            ``resume_token`` must be discarded before the other parts of
            this message, if any, are handled.
        estimated_batch_size (int):
            Estimated size of the buffer required to hold the next batch
            of results.

            This value will be sent with the first ``partial_rows`` of a
            batch. That is, on the first ``partial_rows`` received in a
            stream, on the first message after a ``batch_checksum``
            message, and any time ``reset`` is true.

            The client can use this estimate to allocate a buffer for
            the next batch of results. This helps minimize the number of
            allocations required, though the buffer size may still need
            to be increased if the estimate is too low.
