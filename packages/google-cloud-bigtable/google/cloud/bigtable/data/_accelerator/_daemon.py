"""Subprocess lifecycle wrapper for the Go accelerator daemon binary.

The daemon binary embeds an in-process Go Bigtable client and exposes the
``google.bigtable.v2.Bigtable`` service over a Unix domain socket. This module
owns spawning the binary, waiting for its gRPC server to come up, and tearing
the process down. It issues no RPCs — that's the ``_AcceleratorClient``
companion's job — but it does open a throwaway channel to decide when the
daemon is ready, since on Windows that is the only probe available from
Python (see ``_wait_until_ready``).
