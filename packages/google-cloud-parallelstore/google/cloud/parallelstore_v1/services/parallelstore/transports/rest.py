class ParallelstoreRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for Parallelstore.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the ParallelstoreRestTransport.

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:

       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of instances named

    -  Parallelstore instances are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}``

    Note that location_id must be a Google Cloud ``zone``; for example:

    -  ``projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-parallelstore-share``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
