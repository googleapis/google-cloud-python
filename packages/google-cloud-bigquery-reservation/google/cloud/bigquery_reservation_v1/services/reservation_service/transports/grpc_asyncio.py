class ReservationServiceGrpcAsyncIOTransport(ReservationServiceTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for ReservationService.

    This API allows users to manage their BigQuery reservations.

    A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the
    form of `slots <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots>`__, to
    users. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and
    serves as the basic unit of parallelism. In a scan of a
    multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates on a single
    partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
    resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName``.

    A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for
    BigQuery jobs (in the form of slots) with some committed period of
    usage. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child resource of
    the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id``.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

        Creates an assignment object which allows the given project to

        Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only
        have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination,

        type.

        Different assignments can be created on different levels of the
        projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query
        execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder
        and organization levels in that order. The first assignment
        found is applied to the query.

        When creating assignments, it does not matter if other
        assignments exist at higher levels.

        Example:

        -  The organization ``organizationA`` contains two projects,
           ``project1`` and ``project2``.
        -  Assignments for all three entities (``organizationA``,
           ``project1``, and ``project2``) could all be created and
           mapped to the same or different reservations.

        "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment.
        Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a
        "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent.
        Example parent:
        ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none``.

        Returns ``google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED`` if user does not
        have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the
