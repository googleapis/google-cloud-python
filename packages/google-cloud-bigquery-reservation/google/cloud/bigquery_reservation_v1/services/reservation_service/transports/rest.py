class ReservationServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for ReservationService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the ReservationServiceRestTransport.

    This API allows users to manage their BigQuery reservations.

    A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the
    form of `slots <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots>`__, to
    users. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and
    serves as the basic unit of parallelism. In a scan of a
    multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates on a single
    partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
    resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName``.

    A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for
    BigQuery jobs (in the form of slots) with some committed period of
    usage. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child resource of
    the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id``.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
