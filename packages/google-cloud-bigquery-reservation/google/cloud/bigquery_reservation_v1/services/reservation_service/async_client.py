    A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the
    form of `slots <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots>`__, to
    users. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and
    serves as the basic unit of parallelism. In a scan of a
    multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates on a single
    partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
    resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName``.

    A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for
    BigQuery jobs (in the form of slots) with some committed period of
    usage. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child resource of
    the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id``.

                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and

                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

        r"""Creates an assignment object which allows the given project to
        submit jobs of a certain type using slots from the specified
        reservation.

        Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only
        have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination,
        and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching
        type.

        Different assignments can be created on different levels of the
        projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query
        execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder
        and organization levels in that order. The first assignment
        found is applied to the query.

        When creating assignments, it does not matter if other
        assignments exist at higher levels.

        Example:

        -  The organization ``organizationA`` contains two projects,
           ``project1`` and ``project2``.
        -  Assignments for all three entities (``organizationA``,
           ``project1``, and ``project2``) could all be created and
           mapped to the same or different reservations.

        "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment.
        Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a
        "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent.
        Example parent:
        ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none``.

        Returns ``google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED`` if user does not
        have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the
        reservation and the project that owns this reservation.

        Returns ``google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`` when location of
        the assignment does not match location of the reservation.
