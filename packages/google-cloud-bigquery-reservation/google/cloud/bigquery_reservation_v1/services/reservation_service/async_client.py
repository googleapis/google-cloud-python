    A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the
    form of `slots <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots>`__, to
    users. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and
    serves as the basic unit of parallelism. In a scan of a
    multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates on a single
    partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
    resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName``.

    A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for
    BigQuery jobs (in the form of slots) with some committed period of
    usage. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child resource of
    the admin project and location, e.g.:
    ``projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id``.

                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and

                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment

                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always

                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if

                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``

        have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination,

        type.

        Different assignments can be created on different levels of the

        execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder
        and organization levels in that order. The first assignment
        found is applied to the query.

        When creating assignments, it does not matter if other
        assignments exist at higher levels.

        Example:

        -  The organization ``organizationA`` contains two projects,
           ``project1`` and ``project2``.
        -  Assignments for all three entities (``organizationA``,
           ``project1``, and ``project2``) could all be created and
           mapped to the same or different reservations.

        "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment.
        Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a
        "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent.
        Example parent:

           ``project1`` and ``project2``.
        -  Reservation ``res1`` exists and was created previously.

        In this example, ListAssignments will just return the above two

        will happen.

        The wildcard "-" can be used for reservations in the request. In
        that case all assignments belongs to the specified project and
        location will be listed.

        **Note** "-" cannot be used for projects nor locations.

        2. Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be
           returned.
        3. Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned.

        The same logic applies if the request is about a folder.

        If the request is about an organization, then assignments
        created on the organization will be returned (organization
        doesn't have ancestors).

        Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior
        differences:

        1. permission on the assignee will be verified in this API.
        2. Hierarchy lookup (project->folder->organization) happens in
           this API.
        3. Parent here is ``projects/*/locations/*``, instead of
           ``projects/*/locations/*reservations/*``.
