class ProductSearchGrpcAsyncIOTransport(ProductSearchTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for ProductSearch.

    Manages Products and ProductSets of reference images for use in
    product search. It uses the following resource model:

    -  The API has a collection of
       [ProductSet][google.cloud.vision.v1p4beta1.ProductSet] resources,
       named ``projects/*/locations/*/productSets/*``, which acts as a
       way to put different products into groups to limit
       identification.

    In parallel,

    -  The API has a collection of
       [Product][google.cloud.vision.v1p4beta1.Product] resources, named
       ``projects/*/locations/*/products/*``

    -  Each [Product][google.cloud.vision.v1p4beta1.Product] has a
       collection of
       [ReferenceImage][google.cloud.vision.v1p4beta1.ReferenceImage]
       resources, named
       ``projects/*/locations/*/products/*/referenceImages/*``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

        r"""Return a callable for the purge products method over gRPC.

        Asynchronous API to delete all Products in a ProductSet or all
        Products that are in no ProductSet.

        If a Product is a member of the specified ProductSet in addition
        to other ProductSets, the Product will still be deleted.

        It is recommended to not delete the specified ProductSet until
        after this operation has completed. It is also recommended to
        not add any of the Products involved in the batch delete to a
        new ProductSet while this operation is running because those
        Products may still end up deleted.

        It's not possible to undo the PurgeProducts operation.
        Therefore, it is recommended to keep the csv files used in
        ImportProductSets (if that was how you originally built the
        Product Set) before starting PurgeProducts, in case you need to
        re-import the data after deletion.

        If the plan is to purge all of the Products from a ProductSet
        and then re-use the empty ProductSet to re-import new Products
        into the empty ProductSet, you must wait until the PurgeProducts
        operation has finished for that ProductSet.

        The [google.longrunning.Operation][google.longrunning.Operation]
        API can be used to keep track of the progress and results of the
        request. ``Operation.metadata`` contains
        ``BatchOperationMetadata``. (progress)

        Returns:
            Callable[[~.PurgeProductsRequest],
                    Awaitable[~.Operation]]:
                A function that, when called, will call the underlying RPC
                on the server.
