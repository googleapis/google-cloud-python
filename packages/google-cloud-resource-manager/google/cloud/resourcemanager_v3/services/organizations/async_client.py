                An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
                   controls for Google Cloud resources.

                   A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds
                   one or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                   Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                   Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role
                   is a named list of permissions; each role can be an
                   IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

                   For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding
                   can also specify a condition, which is a logical
                   expression that allows access to a resource only if
                   the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add
                   constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                   resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                   conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
                   documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
