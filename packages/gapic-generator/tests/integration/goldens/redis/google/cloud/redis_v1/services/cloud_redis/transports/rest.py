class CloudRedisRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for CloudRedis.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the CloudRedisRestTransport.

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:

       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named:
       ``/instances/*``
    -  As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}``

    Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP ``region``; for
    example:

    -  ``projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
