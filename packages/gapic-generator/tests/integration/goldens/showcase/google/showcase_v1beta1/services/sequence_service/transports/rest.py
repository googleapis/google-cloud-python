class SequenceServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for SequenceService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the SequenceServiceRestTransport.

        Args:
            host (Optional[str]):
                 The hostname to connect to (default: 'localhost:7469').
            credentials (Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]): The
                authorization credentials to attach to requests. These
                credentials identify the application to the service; if none
                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the
                credentials from the environment.

            credentials_file (Optional[str]): Deprecated. A file with credentials that can
                be loaded with :func:`google.auth.load_credentials_from_file`.
                This argument is ignored if ``channel`` is provided. This argument will be
                removed in the next major version of this library.
            scopes (Optional(Sequence[str])): A list of scopes. This argument is
                ignored if ``channel`` is provided.
            client_cert_source_for_mtls (Callable[[], Tuple[bytes, bytes]]): Client
                certificate to configure mutual TLS HTTP channel. It is ignored
                if ``channel`` is provided.
            quota_project_id (Optional[str]): An optional project to use for billing
                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you are developing
                your own client library.
            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.
            url_scheme: the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally
                "https", but for testing or local servers,
                "http" can be specified.
            interceptor (Optional[SequenceServiceRestInterceptor]): Interceptor used
                to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses.
            api_audience (Optional[str]): The intended audience for the API calls
                to the service that will be set when using certain 3rd party
                authentication flows. Audience is typically a resource identifier.
                If not set, the host value will be used as a default.
