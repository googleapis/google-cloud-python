    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for IAMCredentials.

    A service account is a special type of Google account that
    belongs to your application or a virtual machine (VM), instead
    of to an individual end user. Your application assumes the
    identity of the service account to call Google APIs, so that the
    users aren't directly involved.

    Service account credentials are used to temporarily assume the
    identity of the service account. Supported credential types
    include OAuth 2.0 access tokens, OpenID Connect ID tokens, self-
    signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and more.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
