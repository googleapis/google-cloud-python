    Attributes:
        description (str):
            Optional. Customer specified description of
            the rule. Must be less than or equal to 256

        effect (google.cloud.iam_v3beta.types.AccessPolicyRule.Effect):
            Required. The effect of the rule.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_effect``.
        principals (MutableSequence[str]):
            Required. The identities for which this rule's effect
            governs using one or more permissions on Google Cloud
            resources. This field can contain the following values:

            - ``principal://goog/subject/{email_id}``: A specific Google
              Account. Includes Gmail, Cloud Identity, and Google
              Workspace user accounts. For example,
              ``principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com``.

            - ``principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}``:
              A Google Cloud service account. For example,
              ``principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com``.

            - ``principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}``: A Google group.
              For example,
              ``principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com``.

            - ``principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/{customer_id}``:
              All of the principals associated with the specified Google
              Workspace or Cloud Identity customer ID. For example,
              ``principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/C01Abc35``.

            If an identifier that was previously set on a policy is soft
            deleted, then calls to read that policy will return the
            identifier with a deleted prefix. Users cannot set
            identifiers with this syntax.

            - ``deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}``:
              A specific Google Account that was deleted recently. For
              example,
              ``deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890``.
              If the Google Account is recovered, this identifier
              reverts to the standard identifier for a Google Account.

            - ``deleted:principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}?uid={uid}``:
              A Google group that was deleted recently. For example,
              ``deleted:principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com?uid=1234567890``.
              If the Google group is restored, this identifier reverts
              to the standard identifier for a Google group.

            - ``deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}``:
              A Google Cloud service account that was deleted recently.
              For example,
              ``deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com?uid=1234567890``.
              If the service account is undeleted, this identifier
              reverts to the standard identifier for a service account.
        excluded_principals (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The identities that are excluded from the access
            policy rule, even if they are listed in the ``principals``.
            For example, you could add a Google group to the
            ``principals``, then exclude specific users who belong to
            that group.
        operation (google.cloud.iam_v3beta.types.AccessPolicyRule.Operation):
            Required. Attributes that are used to
            determine whether this rule applies to a
            request.
        conditions (MutableMapping[str, google.type.expr_pb2.Expr]):
            Optional. The conditions that determine whether this rule
            applies to a request. Conditions are identified by their
            key, which is the FQDN of the service that they are relevant
            to. For example:

            ::

               "conditions": {
                "iam.googleapis.com": {
                 "expression": <cel expression>
                }
               }

            Each rule is evaluated independently. If this rule does not
            apply to a request, other rules might still apply. Currently
            supported keys are as follows:

            - ``eventarc.googleapis.com``: Can use ``CEL`` functions
              that evaluate resource fields.

            - ``iam.googleapis.com``: Can use ``CEL`` functions that
              evaluate `resource
              tags <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-tags>`__
              and combine them using boolean and logical operators.
              Other functions and operators are not supported.
