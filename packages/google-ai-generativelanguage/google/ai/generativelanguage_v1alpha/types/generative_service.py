            Optional. A list of ``Tools`` the ``Model`` may use to

            A ``Tool`` is a piece of code that enables the system to

            of actions, outside of knowledge and scope of the ``Model``.
            Supported ``Tool``\ s are ``Function`` and

            This will be enforced on the
            ``GenerateContentRequest.contents`` and
            ``GenerateContentResponse.candidates``. There should not be
            more than one setting for each ``SafetyCategory`` type. The
            API will block any contents and responses that fail to meet
            the thresholds set by these settings. This list overrides
            the default settings for each ``SafetyCategory`` specified
            in the safety_settings. If there is no ``SafetySetting`` for
            a given ``SafetyCategory`` provided in the list, the API

            Note: The default value varies by model, see the

            from the ``getModel`` function.

            Values can range from [0.0, 2.0].

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_temperature``.
        top_p (float):
            Optional. The maximum cumulative probability of tokens to
            consider when sampling.

            The model uses combined Top-k and Top-p (nucleus) sampling.

            Tokens are sorted based on their assigned probabilities so
            that only the most likely tokens are considered. Top-k
            sampling directly limits the maximum number of tokens to
            consider, while Nucleus sampling limits the number of tokens
            based on the cumulative probability.

            Note: The default value varies by ``Model`` and is specified
            by the\ ``Model.top_p`` attribute returned from the
            ``getModel`` function. An empty ``top_k`` attribute
            indicates that the model doesn't apply top-k sampling and
            doesn't allow setting ``top_k`` on requests.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_top_p``.
        top_k (int):
            Optional. The maximum number of tokens to consider when
            sampling.

            Gemini models use Top-p (nucleus) sampling or a combination
            of Top-k and nucleus sampling. Top-k sampling considers the
            set of ``top_k`` most probable tokens. Models running with
            nucleus sampling don't allow top_k setting.

            Note: The default value varies by ``Model`` and is specified
            by the\ ``Model.top_p`` attribute returned from the
            ``getModel`` function. An empty ``top_k`` attribute
            indicates that the model doesn't apply top-k sampling and

        response_mime_type (str):
            Optional. MIME type of the generated candidate text.
            Supported MIME types are: ``text/plain``: (default) Text
            output. ``application/json``: JSON response in the response
            candidates. ``text/x.enum``: ENUM as a string response in
            the response candidates. Refer to the
            `docs <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting_with_media#plain_text_formats>`__

        response_schema (google.ai.generativelanguage_v1alpha.types.Schema):
            Optional. Output schema of the generated candidate text.
            Schemas must be a subset of the `OpenAPI
            schema <https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#schema>`__ and
            can be objects, primitives or arrays.

            If set, a compatible ``response_mime_type`` must also be
            set. Compatible MIME types: ``application/json``: Schema for
            JSON response. Refer to the `JSON text generation
            guide <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/json-mode>`__
            for more details.
        presence_penalty (float):
            Optional. Presence penalty applied to the next token's
            logprobs if the token has already been seen in the response.

            This penalty is binary on/off and not dependant on the
            number of times the token is used (after the first). Use
            [frequency_penalty][google.ai.generativelanguage.v1alpha.GenerationConfig.frequency_penalty]
            for a penalty that increases with each use.

            A positive penalty will discourage the use of tokens that
            have already been used in the response, increasing the
            vocabulary.

            A negative penalty will encourage the use of tokens that
            have already been used in the response, decreasing the
            vocabulary.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_presence_penalty``.
        frequency_penalty (float):
            Optional. Frequency penalty applied to the next token's
            logprobs, multiplied by the number of times each token has
            been seen in the respponse so far.

            A positive penalty will discourage the use of tokens that
            have already been used, proportional to the number of times
            the token has been used: The more a token is used, the more
            dificult it is for the model to use that token again
            increasing the vocabulary of responses.

            Caution: A *negative* penalty will encourage the model to
            reuse tokens proportional to the number of times the token
            has been used. Small negative values will reduce the
            vocabulary of a response. Larger negative values will cause
            the model to start repeating a common token until it hits
            the
            [max_output_tokens][google.ai.generativelanguage.v1alpha.GenerationConfig.max_output_tokens]
            limit.

            Optional. Only valid if
            [response_logprobs=True][google.ai.generativelanguage.v1alpha.GenerationConfig.response_logprobs].
            This sets the number of top logprobs to return at each
            decoding step in the
            [Candidate.logprobs_result][google.ai.generativelanguage.v1alpha.Candidate.logprobs_result].

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_logprobs``.
        enable_enhanced_civic_answers (bool):
            Optional. Enables enhanced civic answers. It
            may not be available for all models.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_enable_enhanced_civic_answers``.
        response_modalities (MutableSequence[google.ai.generativelanguage_v1alpha.types.GenerationConfig.Modality]):
            Optional. The requested modalities of the
            response. Represents the set of modalities that
            the model can return, and should be expected in
            the response. This is an exact match to the
            modalities of the response.

            A model may have multiple combinations of
            supported modalities. If the requested
            modalities do not match any of the supported
            combinations, an error will be returned.
