class ProductInput(proto.Message):
    r"""This resource represents input data you submit for a product, not
    the processed product that you see in Merchant Center, in Shopping
    ads, or across Google surfaces. Product inputs, rules and
    supplemental data source data are combined to create the processed
    [Product][google.shopping.merchant.products.v1.Product]. For more
    information, see `Manage
    products </merchant/api/guides/products/overview>`__.

    Required product input attributes to pass data validation checks are
    primarily defined in the `Products Data
    Specification <https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494>`__.

    The following attributes are required:
    [feedLabel][google.shopping.merchant.products.v1.Product.feed_label],
    [contentLanguage][google.shopping.merchant.products.v1.Product.content_language]
    and
    [offerId][google.shopping.merchant.products.v1.Product.offer_id].

    After inserting, updating, or deleting a product input, it may take
    several minutes before the processed product can be retrieved.

    All fields in the product input and its sub-messages match the
    English name of their corresponding attribute in the `Products Data
    Specification <https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494>`__
    with `some
    exceptions <https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112>`__.
    The following reference documentation lists the field names in the
    **camelCase** casing style while the Products Data Specification
    lists the names in the **snake_case** casing style.


    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The name of the product input. Format:
            ``accounts/{account}/productInputs/{productinput}`` where
            the last section ``productinput`` consists of:
            ``content_language~feed_label~offer_id`` example for product
            input name is ``accounts/123/productInputs/en~US~sku123``. A
            legacy local product input name would be
            ``accounts/123/productInputs/local~en~US~sku123``. Note: For
            calls to the v1beta version, the ``productInput`` section
            consists of:
            ``channel~content_language~feed_label~offer_id``, for
            example: ``accounts/123/productInputs/online~en~US~sku123``.
        product (str):
            Output only. The name of the processed product. Format:
            ``accounts/{account}/products/{product}``
        legacy_local (bool):
            Immutable. Determines whether the product is **only**
            targeting local destinations and whether the product name
            should be distinguished with a ``local~`` prefix. For
            example, ``accounts/123/productInputs/local~en~US~sku123``.
            If a product that is not ``legacy_local`` is already
            targeting local destinations, creating a ``legacy_local``
            product with an otherwise matching name will fail.
        offer_id (str):
            Required. Immutable. Your unique identifier for the product.
            This is the same for the product input and processed
            product. Leading and trailing whitespaces are stripped and
            multiple whitespaces are replaced by a single whitespace
            upon submission. See the `products data
            specification <https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494#id>`__
            for details.
        content_language (str):
            Required. Immutable. The two-letter `ISO
            639-1 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1>`__ language
            code for the product.
        feed_label (str):
            Required. Immutable. The feed label that lets you categorize
            and identify your products. The maximum allowed characters
            are 20, and the supported characters are ``A-Z``, ``0-9``,
            hyphen, and underscore. The feed label must not include any
            spaces. For more information, see `Using feed
            labels <//support.google.com/merchants/answer/14994087>`__.
        version_number (int):
            Optional. Immutable. Represents the existing version
            (freshness) of the product, which can be used to preserve
            the right order when multiple updates are done at the same
            time.

            If set, the insertion is prevented when version number is
            lower than the current version number of the existing
            product. Re-insertion (for example, product refresh after 30
            days) can be performed with the current ``version_number``.

            Only supported for insertions into primary data sources. Do
            not set this field for updates. Do not set this field for
            insertions into supplemental data sources.

            If the operation is prevented, the aborted exception will be
            thrown.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_version_number``.
        product_attributes (google.shopping.merchant_products_v1.types.ProductAttributes):
            Optional. A list of strongly-typed product
            attributes.
        custom_attributes (MutableSequence[google.shopping.type.types.CustomAttribute]):
            Optional. A list of custom (merchant-provided) attributes.
            It can also be used for submitting any attribute of the data
            specification in its generic form (for example,
            ``{ "name": "size type", "value": "regular" }``). This is
            useful for submitting attributes not explicitly exposed by
            the API. Maximum allowed number of characters for each
            custom attribute is 10240 (represents sum of characters for
            name and value). Maximum 2500 custom attributes can be set
            per product, with total size of 102.4kB. Underscores in
            custom attribute names are replaced by spaces upon
            insertion.
