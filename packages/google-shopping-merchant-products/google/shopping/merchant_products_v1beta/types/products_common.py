    Attributes:
        property_name (str):
            Name of the given property. For example,
            "Screen-Resolution" for a TV product. Maximum
            string size is 256 characters.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_property_name``.
        text_value (MutableSequence[str]):
            Text value of the given property. For
            example, "8K(UHD)" could be a text value for a
            TV product. Maximum repeatedness of this value
            is 400. Values are stored in an arbitrary but
            consistent order. Maximum string size is 256
            characters.

            Boolean value of the given property. For
            example for a TV product, "True" or "False" if
            the screen is UHD.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_bool_value``.
        int_value (MutableSequence[int]):
            Integer values of the given property. For
            example, 1080 for a TV product's Screen
            Resolution. Maximum repeatedness of this value
            is 400. Values are stored in an arbitrary but
            consistent order.
        float_value (MutableSequence[float]):
            Float values of the given property. For
            example for a TV product 1.2345. Maximum
            repeatedness of this value is 400. Values are
            stored in an arbitrary but consistent order.
        min_value (float):
            Minimum float value of the given property.
            For example for a TV product 1.00.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_min_value``.
        max_value (float):
            Maximum float value of the given property.
            For example for a TV product 100.00.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_value``.
