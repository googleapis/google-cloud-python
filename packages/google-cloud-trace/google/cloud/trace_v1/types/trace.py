class TraceSpan(proto.Message):
    r"""A span represents a single timed event within a trace. Spans
    can be nested and form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a
    root span that describes the end-to-end latency of an operation
    and, optionally, one or more subspans for its suboperations.
    Spans do not need to be contiguous. There may be gaps between
    spans in a trace.

    Attributes:
        span_id (int):
            Identifier for the span. Must be a 64-bit integer other than
            0 and unique within a trace. For example,
            ``2205310701640571284``.
        kind (google.cloud.trace_v1.types.TraceSpan.SpanKind):
            Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular
            context. For example, two spans with the same name may be
            distinguished using ``RPC_CLIENT`` and ``RPC_SERVER`` to
            identify queueing latency associated with the span.
        name (str):
            Name of the span. Must be less than 128
            bytes. The span name is sanitized and displayed
            in the Stackdriver Trace tool in the Google
            Cloud Platform Console.
            The name may be a method name or some other per-
            call site name. For the same executable and the
            same call point, a best practice is to use a
            consistent name, which makes it easier to
            correlate cross-trace spans.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Start time of the span in nanoseconds from
            the UNIX epoch.
        end_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            End time of the span in nanoseconds from the
            UNIX epoch.
        parent_span_id (int):
            Optional. ID of the parent span, if any.
        labels (Sequence[google.cloud.trace_v1.types.TraceSpan.LabelsEntry]):
            Collection of labels associated with the span. Label keys
            must be less than 128 bytes. Label values must be less than
            16 kilobytes (10MB for ``/stacktrace`` values).

            Some predefined label keys exist, or you may create your
            own. When creating your own, we recommend the following
            formats:

            -  ``/category/product/key`` for agents of well-known
               products (e.g. ``/db/mongodb/read_size``).
            -  ``short_host/path/key`` for domain-specific keys (e.g.
               ``foo.com/myproduct/bar``)

            Predefined labels include:

            -  ``/agent``
            -  ``/component``
            -  ``/error/message``
            -  ``/error/name``
            -  ``/http/client_city``
            -  ``/http/client_country``
            -  ``/http/client_protocol``
            -  ``/http/client_region``
            -  ``/http/host``
            -  ``/http/method``

            Optional. Type of data returned for traces in the list.
            Default is ``MINIMAL``.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. Maximum number of traces to return.
            If not specified or <= 0, the implementation
            selects a reasonable value.  The implementation
            may return fewer traces than the requested page
            size.
        page_token (str):
            Token identifying the page of results to return. If
            provided, use the value of the ``next_page_token`` field
            from a previous request.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Start of the time interval (inclusive) during
            which the trace data was collected from the

        end_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            End of the time interval (inclusive) during

            application.
        filter (str):
            Optional. A filter against labels for the request.

            By default, searches use prefix matching. To specify exact
            match, prepend a plus symbol (``+``) to the search term.
            Multiple terms are ANDed. Syntax:

            -  ``root:NAME_PREFIX`` or ``NAME_PREFIX``: Return traces
               where any root span starts with ``NAME_PREFIX``.
            -  ``+root:NAME`` or ``+NAME``: Return traces where any root
               span's name is exactly ``NAME``.
            -  ``span:NAME_PREFIX``: Return traces where any span starts
               with ``NAME_PREFIX``.
            -  ``+span:NAME``: Return traces where any span's name is
               exactly ``NAME``.
            -  ``latency:DURATION``: Return traces whose overall latency
               is greater or equal to than ``DURATION``. Accepted units
               are nanoseconds (``ns``), milliseconds (``ms``), and
               seconds (``s``). Default is ``ms``. For example,
               ``latency:24ms`` returns traces whose overall latency is
               greater than or equal to 24 milliseconds.
            -  ``label:LABEL_KEY``: Return all traces containing the
               specified label key (exact match, case-sensitive)
               regardless of the key:value pair's value (including empty
               values).
            -  ``LABEL_KEY:VALUE_PREFIX``: Return all traces containing
               the specified label key (exact match, case-sensitive)
               whose value starts with ``VALUE_PREFIX``. Both a key and
               a value must be specified.
            -  ``+LABEL_KEY:VALUE``: Return all traces containing a
               key:value pair exactly matching the specified text. Both
               a key and a value must be specified.
            -  ``method:VALUE``: Equivalent to ``/http/method:VALUE``.
            -  ``url:VALUE``: Equivalent to ``/http/url:VALUE``.
        order_by (str):
            Optional. Field used to sort the returned traces. Can be one
            of the following:

            -  ``trace_id``
            -  ``name`` (``name`` field of root span in the trace)
            -  ``duration`` (difference between ``end_time`` and
               ``start_time`` fields of the root span)
            -  ``start`` (``start_time`` field of the root span)

            Descending order can be specified by appending ``desc`` to
            the sort field (for example, ``name desc``).

            Only one sort field is permitted.
