class Span(proto.Message):
    r"""A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans
    can be nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a
    root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more
    subspans for its sub-operations.

    A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all.
    Spans do not need to be contiguous. There might be
    gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The resource name of the span in the following
            format:

            -  ``projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/[SPAN_ID]``

            ``[TRACE_ID]`` is a unique identifier for a trace within a
            project; it is a 32-character hexadecimal encoding of a
            16-byte array. It should not be zero.

            ``[SPAN_ID]`` is a unique identifier for a span within a
            trace; it is a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an
            8-byte array. It should not be zero. .
        span_id (str):
            Required. The ``[SPAN_ID]`` portion of the span's resource
            name.
        parent_span_id (str):
            The ``[SPAN_ID]`` of this span's parent span. If this is a
            root span, then this field must be empty.
        display_name (google.cloud.trace_v2.types.TruncatableString):
            Required. A description of the span's
            operation (up to 128 bytes). Cloud Trace
            displays the description in the Cloud console.
            For example, the display name can be a qualified
            method name or a file name and a line number
            where the operation is called. A best practice
            is to use the same display name within an
            application and at the same call point. This
            makes it easier to correlate spans in different
            traces.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Required. The start time of the span. On the
            client side, this is the time kept by the local
            machine where the span execution starts. On the
            server side, this is the time when the server's
            application handler starts running.
        end_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Required. The end time of the span. On the
            client side, this is the time kept by the local
            machine where the span execution ends. On the
            server side, this is the time when the server
            application handler stops running.
        attributes (google.cloud.trace_v2.types.Span.Attributes):
            A set of attributes on the span. You can have
            up to 32 attributes per span.
        stack_trace (google.cloud.trace_v2.types.StackTrace):
            Stack trace captured at the start of the
            span.
        time_events (google.cloud.trace_v2.types.Span.TimeEvents):
            A set of time events. You can have up to 32
            annotations and 128 message events per span.
        links (google.cloud.trace_v2.types.Span.Links):
            Links associated with the span. You can have
            up to 128 links per Span.
        status (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
            Optional. The final status for this span.
        same_process_as_parent_span (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Optional. Set this parameter to indicate
            whether this span is in the same process as its
            parent. If you do not set this parameter, Trace
            is unable to take advantage of this helpful
            information.
        child_span_count (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            Optional. The number of child spans that were
            generated while this span was active. If set,
            allows implementation to detect missing child
            spans.
        span_kind (google.cloud.trace_v2.types.Span.SpanKind):
            Optional. Distinguishes between spans generated in a
            particular context. For example, two spans with the same
            name may be distinguished using ``CLIENT`` (caller) and
            ``SERVER`` (callee) to identify an RPC call.
