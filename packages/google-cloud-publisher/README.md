# Google Cloud Publisher API Client Library for Python

**Note: This is a prototype for a proposed client library and is not yet officially supported.**

This library provides a client for the Google Play Android Publisher API. It is designed to be a lightweight, modern alternative to the `google-api-client` library, making it suitable for environments with package size constraints like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.

### Features (Proposed)
* Modern, idiomatic Python client.
* Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
* Lightweight with minimal dependencies.

### Installation (Proposed)
```bash
pip install google-cloud-publisher
