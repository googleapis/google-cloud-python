            Contains an identifier for a subtype of recommendations
            produced for the same recommender. Subtype is a function of
            content and impact, meaning a new subtype might be added
            when significant changes to ``content`` or
            ``primary_impact.category`` are introduced. See the
            Recommenders section to see a list of subtypes for a given
            Recommender.

            Examples: For recommender = "google.iam.policy.Recommender",
            recommender_subtype can be one of
            "REMOVE_ROLE"/"REPLACE_ROLE".

            category.
        additional_impact (MutableSequence[google.cloud.recommender_v1.types.Impact]):
            Optional set of additional impact that this
            recommendation may have when trying to optimize
            for the primary category. These may be positive
            or negative.
        priority (google.cloud.recommender_v1.types.Recommendation.Priority):
            Recommendation's priority.
        content (google.cloud.recommender_v1.types.RecommendationContent):
            Content of the recommendation describing
            recommended changes to resources.
        state_info (google.cloud.recommender_v1.types.RecommendationStateInfo):
            Information for state. Contains state and
            metadata.

        xor_group_id (str):
            Corresponds to a mutually exclusive group ID
            within a recommender. A non-empty ID indicates
            that the recommendation belongs to a mutually
            exclusive group. This means that only one
            recommendation within the group is suggested to
            be applied.

            Type of this operation. Contains one of
            'add', 'remove', 'replace', 'move', 'copy',
            'test' and custom operations. This field is
            case-insensitive and always populated.
        resource_type (str):
            Type of GCP resource being modified/tested.
            This field is always populated. Example:
            cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project,
            compute.googleapis.com/Instance
        resource (str):
            Contains the fully qualified resource name.
            This field is always populated. ex:
            //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/foo.

            If the operation is at the resource level, then
            path should be "/". This field is always
            populated.
        source_resource (str):
            Can be set with action 'copy' to copy resource configuration
            across different resources of the same type. Example: A
            resource clone can be done via action = 'copy', path = "/",
            from = "/", source_resource = and resource_name = . This
            field is empty for all other values of ``action``.
        source_path (str):
            Can be set with action 'copy' or 'move' to indicate the
            source field within resource or source_resource, ignored if
            provided for other operation types.
        value (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value):
            Value for the ``path`` field. Will be set for
            actions:'add'/'replace'. Maybe set for action: 'test'.
            Either this or ``value_matcher`` will be set for 'test'
            operation. An exact match must be performed.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``path_value``.
        value_matcher (google.cloud.recommender_v1.types.ValueMatcher):
            Can be set for action 'test' for advanced matching for the
            value of 'path' field. Either this or ``value`` will be set
            for 'test' operation.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``path_value``.
        path_filters (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Set of filters to apply if ``path`` refers to array elements
            or nested array elements in order to narrow down to a single
            unique element that is being tested/modified. This is
            intended to be an exact match per filter. To perform
            advanced matching, use path_value_matchers.

            -  Example:

            ::

               {
                 "/versions/*/name" : "it-123"
                 "/versions/*/targetSize/percent": 20
               }

            ::

               {
                 "/bindings/*/role": "roles/owner"
                 "/bindings/*/condition" : null
               }

            -  Example:

            ::

               {
                 "/bindings/*/role": "roles/owner"

            When both path_filters and path_value_matchers are set, an
            implicit AND must be performed.
        path_value_matchers (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.recommender_v1.types.ValueMatcher]):
            Similar to path_filters, this contains set of filters to
            apply if ``path`` field refers to array elements. This is
            meant to support value matching beyond exact match. To
            perform exact match, use path_filters. When both
            path_filters and path_value_matchers are set, an implicit
            AND must be performed.
