        include_prefixes (MutableSequence[str]):
            If you specify ``include_prefixes``, Storage Transfer
            Service uses the items in the ``include_prefixes`` array to

            [exclude_prefixes][google.storagetransfer.v1.ObjectConditions.exclude_prefixes]
            is specified, objects must not start with any of the
            ``exclude_prefixes`` specified for inclusion in the
            transfer.

            The following are requirements of ``include_prefixes``:

            -  Each include-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode
               characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when
               UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or
               Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular
               expression matching are not supported.

            -  Each include-prefix must omit the leading slash. For
               example, to include the object
               ``s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz``, specify
               the include-prefix as ``logs/y=2015/requests.gz``.

            -  None of the include-prefix values can be empty, if
               specified.

            -  Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of
               the object namespace. No include-prefix may be a prefix
               of another include-prefix.

            The max size of ``include_prefixes`` is 1000.

            For more information, see `Filtering objects from
            transfers </storage-transfer/docs/filtering-objects-from-transfers>`__.
        exclude_prefixes (MutableSequence[str]):
            If you specify ``exclude_prefixes``, Storage Transfer

            for inclusion in a transfer.

            The following are requirements of ``exclude_prefixes``:

            -  Each exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode
               characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when

               the object namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix

               [include_prefixes][google.storagetransfer.v1.ObjectConditions.include_prefixes]
               is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with
               the value of a path explicitly included by
               ``include_prefixes``.

            The max size of ``exclude_prefixes`` is 1000.

    r"""An HttpData resource specifies a list of objects on the web to be
    transferred over HTTP. The information of the objects to be
    transferred is contained in a file referenced by a URL. The first
    line in the file must be ``"TsvHttpData-1.0"``, which specifies the
    format of the file. Subsequent lines specify the information of the
    list of objects, one object per list entry. Each entry has the
    following tab-delimited fields:

    -  **HTTP URL** — The location of the object.

    -  **Length** — The size of the object in bytes.

    -  **MD5** — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object.

    For an example of a valid TSV file, see `Transferring data from
    URLs <https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list>`__.

    When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in
    mind:

    -  When an object located at ``http(s)://hostname:port/<URL-path>``
       is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data
       sink is ``<hostname>/<URL-path>``.

    -  If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size
       of the object fetched, the object is not transferred.

    -  If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the
       transferred bytes, the object transfer fails.

    -  Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For
       example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly]
       (/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it.

    -  Storage Transfer Service obeys ``robots.txt`` rules and requires
       the source HTTP server to support ``Range`` requests and to
       return a ``Content-Length`` header in each response.

    -  [ObjectConditions][google.storagetransfer.v1.ObjectConditions]
       have no effect when filtering objects to transfer.
