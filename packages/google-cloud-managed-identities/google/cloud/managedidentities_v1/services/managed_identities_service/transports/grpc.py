    API Overview

    The ``managedidentites.googleapis.com`` service implements the
    Google Cloud Managed Identites API for identity services (e.g.
    Microsoft Active Directory).

    The Managed Identities service provides methods to manage
    (create/read/update/delete) domains, reset managed identities admin
    password, add/remove domain controllers in GCP regions and
    add/remove VPC peering.

    Data Model

    The Managed Identities service exposes the following resources:

    -  Locations as global, named as follows:
       ``projects/{project_id}/locations/global``.

    -  Domains, named as follows:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domain/{domain_name}``.

    The ``{domain_name}`` refers to fully qualified domain name in the
    customer project e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the
    following restrictions:

    -  Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods and
       hyphens.
    -  Must start with a letter.
    -  Must contain between 2-64 characters.
    -  Must end with a number or a letter.
    -  Must not start with period.
    -  First segement length (mydomain form example above) shouldn't
       exceed 15 chars.
    -  The last segment cannot be fully numeric.
    -  Must be unique within the customer project.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the

                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``

            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
