    """API Overview

    The ``managedidentites.googleapis.com`` service implements the
    Google Cloud Managed Identites API for identity services (e.g.
    Microsoft Active Directory).

    The Managed Identities service provides methods to manage
    (create/read/update/delete) domains, reset managed identities admin
    password, add/remove domain controllers in GCP regions and
    add/remove VPC peering.

    Data Model

    The Managed Identities service exposes the following resources:

    -  Locations as global, named as follows:
       ``projects/{project_id}/locations/global``.

    -  Domains, named as follows:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domain/{domain_name}``.

    The ``{domain_name}`` refers to fully qualified domain name in the
    customer project e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the
    following restrictions:

    -  Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods and
       hyphens.
    -  Must start with a letter.
    -  Must contain between 2-64 characters.
    -  Must end with a number or a letter.
    -  Must not start with period.
    -  First segement length (mydomain form example above) shouldn't
       exceed 15 chars.
    -  The last segment cannot be fully numeric.
    -  Must be unique within the customer project.

                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is
                currently not supported for mTLS.

                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
