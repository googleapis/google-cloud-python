                the primary place, but does not necessarily provide access
                to the place.

                For example, if the primary place is a restaurant in a strip
                mall, the "PREFERRED" entrances will be the ones that likely
                lead into the restaurant itself, while the other returned

                to the main foyer area, but if an entrance only provides
                access to a store on the side of the building, it won't be a
                ``PREFERRED`` entrance.

                Note: a ``PREFERRED`` entrance might not provide access to
