Authentication
--------------

With ``google-cloud-python`` we try to make authentication as painless as
possible. Check out the `Authentication section`_ in our documentation to
learn more. You may also find the `authentication document`_ shared by all
the ``google-cloud-*`` libraries to be helpful.

Using the API
-------------

The Google Cloud `Natural Language`_ API (`Natural Language API docs`_)
provides natural language understanding technologies to developers,
including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and syntax analysis.
This API is part of the larger Cloud Machine Learning API.
