# TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/14142):
# Reduce this timeout by moving the installation of Python runtimes to a separate base image
timeout: 7200s  # 2 hours for the first uncached run, can be lowered later.
steps:
  # A single step using the Kaniko executor to build and cache
  - name: 'gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest'
    args:
      # Specifies the Dockerfile path
      - '--dockerfile=.generator/Dockerfile'
      # Specifies the build context directory
      - '--context=.'
      # The final destination for the image
      - '--destination=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-sdk-librarian-prod/images-dev/python-librarian-generator:latest'
      # Enables Kaniko's remote registry caching
      - '--cache=true'
      # (Optional but recommended) Sets a time-to-live for cache layers
      - '--cache-ttl=24h'

# The 'images' section is no longer needed because Kaniko pushes the image itself.
