# TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/14142):
# Reduce this timeout by moving the installation of Python runtimes to a separate base image
timeout: 7200s  # 2 hours for the first uncached run, can be lowered later.
steps:
  # STEP 1: Pull the latest version of the image to use as a cache.
  # The '|| exit 0' part ensures the build doesn't fail if the image
  # doesn't exist yet (e.g., on the very first run).
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: ['-c', 'docker pull gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-librarian-generator:latest || exit 0']

  # STEP 2: Build the new image, using the pulled image as a cache source.
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '--tag=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-librarian-generator:latest'
      - '--cache-from=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-librarian-generator:latest'
      - '--file=.generator/Dockerfile'
      - '.'
    env:
      - 'DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1'

# STEP 3: Push the newly built image to the registry so it can be used
# as the cache for the next run. Cloud Build does this automatically if
# the image is listed in the 'images' section.
images:
  - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-librarian-generator:latest'

# This section automatically creates a storage bucket for storing docker build logs.
