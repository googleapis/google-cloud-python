    when created from a template.

    Attributes:
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and
            categorize objects. User-provided labels are shared with
            Google's billing system, so they can be used to filter, or
            break down billing charges by team, component, environment,
            state, etc. For more information, visit
            https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels
            or https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/labels.

            .. raw:: html

                <p>Cloud Run API v2 does not support labels with `run.googleapis.com`,
                `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev`
                namespaces, and they will be rejected. All system labels in v1 now have a
                corresponding field in v2 ExecutionTemplate.
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Unstructured key value map that may be set by external tools
            to store and arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and
            should be preserved when modifying objects.

            .. raw:: html

                <p>Cloud Run API v2 does not support annotations with `run.googleapis.com`,
                `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev`
                namespaces, and they will be rejected. All system annotations in v1 now
                have a corresponding field in v2 ExecutionTemplate.

            .. raw:: html

                <p>This field follows Kubernetes annotations' namespacing, limits, and
                rules.
        parallelism (int):
            Specifies the maximum desired number of tasks the execution
            should run at given time. Must be <= task_count. When the
            job is run, if this field is 0 or unset, the maximum
            possible value will be used for that execution. The actual
            number of tasks running in steady state will be less than
            this number when there are fewer tasks waiting to be
            completed remaining, i.e. when the work left to do is less
            than max parallelism.
        task_count (int):
            Specifies the desired number of tasks the
            execution should run. Setting to 1 means that
            parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of
            that task signals the success of the execution.
            Defaults to 1.
        template (google.cloud.run_v2.types.TaskTemplate):
            Required. Describes the task(s) that will be
            created when executing an execution.
