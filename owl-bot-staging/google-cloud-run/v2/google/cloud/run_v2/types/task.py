            increases every time the user modifies the
            desired state.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Output only. Unstructured key value map that
            can be used to organize and categorize objects.
            User-provided labels are shared with Google's

            separate operations.
        scheduled_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Represents time when the task
            was scheduled to run by the system. It is not
            guaranteed to be set in happens-before order
            across separate operations.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            Output only. The last-modified time.
        delete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. For a deleted resource, the

            Output only. For a deleted resource, the time
            after which it will be permamently deleted. It
            is only populated as a response to a Delete
            request.

            active before the system will actively try to
            mark it failed and kill associated containers.
            This applies per attempt of a task, meaning each
            retry can run for the full timeout.
        service_account (str):
            Email address of the IAM service account
            associated with the Task of a Job. The service
            account represents the identity of the running
            task, and determines what permissions the task
            has. If not provided, the task will use the

            desired state.
        observed_generation (int):
            Output only. The generation of this Task. See comments in
            ``Job.reconciling`` for additional information on
            reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
        index (int):
            Output only. Index of the Task, unique per
            execution, and beginning at 0.
        retried (int):
            Output only. The number of times this Task
            was retried. Tasks are retried when they fail up
            to the maxRetries limit.
        last_attempt_result (google.cloud.run_v2.types.TaskAttemptResult):
            Output only. Result of the last attempt of
            this Task.

        vpc_access (google.cloud.run_v2.types.VpcAccess):
            Output only. VPC Access configuration to use
            for this Task. For more information, visit
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-vpc.
        log_uri (str):
            Output only. URI where logs for this
            execution can be found in Cloud Console.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Output only. Reserved for future use.
        etag (str):
            Output only. A system-generated fingerprint
            for this version of the resource. May be used to
            detect modification conflict during updates.
