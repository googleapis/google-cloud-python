class SetUpSpaceRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request to create a space and add specified users to it.

    Attributes:
        space (google.apps.chat_v1.types.Space):
            Required. The ``Space.spaceType`` field is required.

            To create a space, set ``Space.spaceType`` to ``SPACE`` and
            set ``Space.displayName``. If you receive the error message
            ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` when setting up a space, try a different
            ``displayName``. An existing space within the Google
            Workspace organization might already use this display name.

            To create a group chat, set ``Space.spaceType`` to
            ``GROUP_CHAT``. Don't set ``Space.displayName``.

            To create a 1:1 conversation between humans, set
            ``Space.spaceType`` to ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` and set
            ``Space.singleUserBotDm`` to ``false``. Don't set
            ``Space.displayName`` or ``Space.spaceDetails``.

            To create an 1:1 conversation between a human and the
            calling Chat app, set ``Space.spaceType`` to
            ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` and ``Space.singleUserBotDm`` to
            ``true``. Don't set ``Space.displayName`` or
            ``Space.spaceDetails``.

            If a ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` space already exists, that space is
            returned instead of creating a new space.
        request_id (str):
            Optional. A unique identifier for this
            request. A random UUID is recommended.
            Specifying an existing request ID returns the
            space created with that ID instead of creating a
            new space.
            Specifying an existing request ID from the same
            Chat app with a different authenticated user
            returns an error.
        memberships (MutableSequence[google.apps.chat_v1.types.Membership]):
            Optional. The Google Chat users or groups to invite to join
            the space. Omit the calling user, as they are added
            automatically.

            The set currently allows up to 20 memberships (in addition
            to the caller).

            For human membership, the ``Membership.member`` field must
            contain a ``user`` with ``name`` populated (format:
            ``users/{user}``) and ``type`` set to ``User.Type.HUMAN``.
            You can only add human users when setting up a space (adding
            Chat apps is only supported for direct message setup with
            the calling app). You can also add members using the user's
            email as an alias for {user}. For example, the ``user.name``
            can be ``users/example@gmail.com``. To invite Gmail users or
            users from external Google Workspace domains, user's email
            must be used for ``{user}``.

            For Google group membership, the ``Membership.group_member``
            field must contain a ``group`` with ``name`` populated
            (format ``groups/{group}``). You can only add Google groups
            when setting ``Space.spaceType`` to ``SPACE``.

            Optional when setting ``Space.spaceType`` to ``SPACE``.

            Required when setting ``Space.spaceType`` to ``GROUP_CHAT``,
            along with at least two memberships.

            Required when setting ``Space.spaceType`` to
            ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` with a human user, along with exactly one
            membership.

            Must be empty when creating a 1:1 conversation between a
            human and the calling Chat app (when setting
            ``Space.spaceType`` to ``DIRECT_MESSAGE`` and
            ``Space.singleUserBotDm`` to ``true``).
