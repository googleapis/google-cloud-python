class Domain(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a managed Microsoft Active Directory domain.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The unique name of the domain using the form:
            ``projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domains/{domain_name}``.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Resource labels that can contain
            user-provided metadata.
        authorized_networks (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. The full names of the Google Compute Engine
            `networks </compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks>`__
            the domain instance is connected to. Networks can be added
            using UpdateDomain. The domain is only available on networks
            listed in ``authorized_networks``. If CIDR subnets overlap
            between networks, domain creation will fail.
        reserved_ip_range (str):
            Required. The CIDR range of internal addresses that are
            reserved for this domain. Reserved networks must be /24 or
            larger. Ranges must be unique and non-overlapping with
            existing subnets in [Domain].[authorized_networks].
        locations (MutableSequence[str]):
            Required. Locations where domain needs to be provisioned.
            [regions][compute/docs/regions-zones/] e.g. us-west1 or
            us-east4 Service supports up to 4 locations at once. Each
            location will use a /26 block.
        admin (str):
            Optional. The name of delegated administrator account used
            to perform Active Directory operations. If not specified,
            ``setupadmin`` will be used.
        fqdn (str):
            Output only. The fully-qualified domain name
            of the exposed domain used by clients to connect
            to the service. Similar to what would be chosen
            for an Active Directory set up on an internal
            network.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the instance was
            created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last update time.
        state (google.cloud.managedidentities_v1.types.Domain.State):
            Output only. The current state of this
            domain.
        status_message (str):
            Output only. Additional information about the
            current status of this domain, if available.
        trusts (MutableSequence[google.cloud.managedidentities_v1.types.Trust]):
            Output only. The current trusts associated
            with the domain.
