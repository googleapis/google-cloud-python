            The ``ExecResource`` has 2 stages: ``validate`` and ``enforce`` and
            both stages accept a script as an argument to execute.

            When the ``ExecResource`` is applied by the agent, it first executes
            the script in the ``validate`` stage. The ``validate`` stage can
            signal that the ``ExecResource`` is already in the desired state by
            returning an exit code of ``100``. If the ``ExecResource`` is not in
            the desired state, it should return an exit code of ``101``. Any
            other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error.

            If the ``ExecResource`` is not in the desired state based on the
            exit code from the ``validate`` stage, the agent proceeds to execute
            the script from the ``enforce`` stage. If the ``ExecResource`` is
            already in the desired state, the ``enforce`` stage will not be run.
            Similar to ``validate`` stage, the ``enforce`` stage should return
            an exit code of ``100`` to indicate that the resource in now in its
            desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error.

            NOTE: An exit code of ``100`` was chosen over ``0`` (and ``101`` vs
            ``1``) to have an explicit indicator of ``in desired state``,
            ``not in desired state`` and errors. Because, for example,
            Powershell will always return an exit code of ``0`` unless an
            ``exit`` statement is provided in the script. So, for reasons of
            consistency and being explicit, exit codes ``100`` and ``101`` were
            chosen.
