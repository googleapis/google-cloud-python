class BuildOccurrence(proto.Message):

    Attributes:
        provenance (grafeas.grafeas_v1.types.BuildProvenance):
            The actual provenance for the build.
        provenance_bytes (str):
            Serialized JSON representation of the provenance, used in
            generating the build signature in the corresponding build
            note. After verifying the signature, ``provenance_bytes``
            can be unmarshalled and compared to the provenance to
            confirm that it is unchanged. A base64-encoded string
            representation of the provenance bytes is used for the
            signature in order to interoperate with openssl which
            expects this format for signature verification.

            The serialized form is captured both to avoid ambiguity in
            how the provenance is marshalled to json as well to prevent
            incompatibilities with future changes.
        intoto_provenance (grafeas.grafeas_v1.types.InTotoProvenance):
            Deprecated. See InTotoStatement for the

            as defined in spec.
        intoto_statement (grafeas.grafeas_v1.types.InTotoStatement):
            In-toto Statement representation as defined in spec. The
            intoto_statement can contain any type of provenance. The
            serialized payload of the statement can be stored and signed
            in the Occurrence's envelope.
        in_toto_slsa_provenance_v1 (grafeas.grafeas_v1.types.InTotoSlsaProvenanceV1):
            In-Toto Slsa Provenance V1 represents a slsa
            provenance meeting the slsa spec, wrapped in an
            in-toto statement. This allows for direct
            jsonification of a to-spec in-toto slsa
            statement with a to-spec slsa provenance.
