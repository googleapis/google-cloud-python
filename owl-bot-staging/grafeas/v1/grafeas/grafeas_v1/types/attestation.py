    act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences
    (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security
    boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach
    an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of
    lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they
    don't all live in the same project.

        purpose of the authority. Because the name of a note acts as its
        resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the
        canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security
        purposes) from "readable" names more suitable for debug output.
        Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities
        in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
        attestations to verify.

    authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the
    attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the
    signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish
    trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this
    attestation is attached is primarily useful for lookup (how to
    find this attestation if you already know the authority and
    artifact to be verified) and intent (for which authority this
    attestation was intended to sign.

            implementations should consider this attestation message
            verified if at least one ``signature`` verifies
            ``serialized_payload``. See ``Signature`` in common.proto

            One or more JWTs encoding a self-contained attestation. Each
            JWT encodes the payload that it verifies within the JWT
            itself. Verifier implementation SHOULD ignore the
            ``serialized_payload`` field when verifying these JWTs. If
            only JWTs are present on this AttestationOccurrence, then
            the ``serialized_payload`` SHOULD be left empty. Each JWT
            SHOULD encode a claim specific to the ``resource_uri`` of
            this Occurrence, but this is not validated by Grafeas
            metadata API implementations. The JWT itself is opaque to
