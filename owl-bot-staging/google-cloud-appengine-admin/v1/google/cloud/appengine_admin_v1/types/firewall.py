class FirewallRule(proto.Message):
    r"""A single firewall rule that is evaluated against incoming
    traffic and provides an action to take on matched requests.

    Attributes:
        priority (int):
            A positive integer between [1, Int32.MaxValue-1] that
            defines the order of rule evaluation. Rules with the lowest
            priority are evaluated first.

            A default rule at priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4
            and IPv6 traffic when no previous rule matches. Only the
            action of this rule can be modified by the user.
        action (google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.FirewallRule.Action):
            The action to take on matched requests.
        source_range (str):
            IP address or range, defined using CIDR notation, of
            requests that this rule applies to. You can use the wildcard
            character "*" to match all IPs equivalent to "0/0" and
            "::/0" together. Examples: ``192.168.1.1`` or
            ``192.168.0.0/16`` or ``2001:db8::/32`` or
            ``2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334``.

                <p>Truncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not
                properly truncated. For example, `1.2.3.4/24` is accepted as the same
                address as `1.2.3.0/24`. Similarly, for IPv6, `2001:db8::1/32` is accepted
                as the same address as `2001:db8::/32`.
        description (str):
            An optional string description of this rule.
            This field has a maximum length of 100
            characters.
