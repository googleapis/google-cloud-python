class Service(proto.Message):
    r"""A Service resource is a logical component of an application
    that can share state and communicate in a secure fashion with
    other services. For example, an application that handles
    customer requests might include separate services to handle
    tasks such as backend data analysis or API requests from mobile
    devices. Each service has a collection of versions that define a
    specific set of code used to implement the functionality of that
    service.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Full path to the Service resource in the API. Example:
            ``apps/myapp/services/default``.

            @OutputOnly
        id (str):
            Relative name of the service within the application.
            Example: ``default``.

            @OutputOnly
        split (google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.TrafficSplit):
            Mapping that defines fractional HTTP traffic
            diversion to different versions within the
            service.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            A set of labels to apply to this service.
            Labels are key/value pairs that describe the
            service and all resources that belong to it
            (e.g., versions). The labels can be used to
            search and group resources, and are propagated
            to the usage and billing reports, enabling
            fine-grain analysis of costs. An example of
            using labels is to tag resources belonging to
            different environments (e.g., "env=prod",
            "env=qa").

            <p>Label keys and values can be no longer than
            63 characters and can only contain lowercase
            letters, numeric characters, underscores,
            dashes, and international characters. Label keys
            must start with a lowercase letter or an
            international character. Each service can have
            at most 32 labels.
        network_settings (google.cloud.appengine_admin_v1.types.NetworkSettings):
            Ingress settings for this service. Will apply
            to all versions.

            Mechanism used to determine which version a
            request is sent to. The traffic selection
            algorithm will be stable for either type until
            allocations are changed.
        allocations (MutableMapping[str, float]):
            Mapping from version IDs within the service to fractional
            (0.000, 1] allocations of traffic for that version. Each
            version can be specified only once, but some versions in the
            service may not have any traffic allocation. Services that
            have traffic allocated cannot be deleted until either the
            service is deleted or their traffic allocation is removed.
            Allocations must sum to 1. Up to two decimal place precision
            is supported for IP-based splits and up to three decimal
            places is supported for cookie-based splits.

                Diversion based on applying the modulus

            RANDOM (3):
                Diversion based on weighted random
                assignment. An incoming request is randomly
                routed to a version in the traffic split, with
                probability proportional to the version's
                traffic share.
