            object <https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format>`__

            of the email notification options, either using the default
            IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification
            channels.

            To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the
            following:

            1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your
               budget. For guidance, see `Manage programmatic budget
               alert
               notifications <https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications>`__.

               permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call
               fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on

            [NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic][google.cloud.billing.budgets.v1.NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic]
            is set. The schema version of the notification sent to

        monitoring_notification_channels (MutableSequence[str]):

            threshold is exceeded. This is in addition to the
            ``DefaultIamRecipients`` who receive alert emails based on
            their billing account IAM role. The value is the full REST
            resource name of a Cloud Monitoring email notification
            channel with the form
            ``projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}``.
            A maximum of 5 email notifications are allowed.

            To customize budget alert email recipients with monitoring
            notification channels, you *must create the monitoring
            notification channels before you link them to a budget*. For
            guidance on setting up notification channels to use with
            budgets, see `Customize budget alert email
            recipients <https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients>`__.

            For Cloud Billing budget alerts, you *must use email
            notification channels*. The other types of notification
            channels are *not* supported, such as Slack, SMS, or
            PagerDuty. If you want to `send budget notifications to
            Slack <https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/notify#send_notifications_to_slack>`__,
            use a pubsubTopic and configure `programmatic

            Billing Account Administrator and Billing
