class ProductSearchParams(proto.Message):

    Attributes:
        bounding_poly (google.cloud.vision_v1p4beta1.types.BoundingPoly):
            The bounding polygon around the area of
            interest in the image. If it is not specified,
            system discretion will be applied.
        product_set (str):
            The resource name of a
            [ProductSet][google.cloud.vision.v1p4beta1.ProductSet] to be
            searched for similar images.

            Format is:
            ``projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID``.
        product_categories (MutableSequence[str]):
            The list of product categories to search in.
            Currently, we only consider the first category,
            and either "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2",
            "toys-v2", "packagedgoods-v1", or "general-v1"
            should be specified. The legacy categories
            "homegoods", "apparel", and "toys" are still
            supported but will be deprecated. For new
            products, please use "homegoods-v2",
            "apparel-v2", or "toys-v2" for better product
            search accuracy. It is recommended to migrate
            existing products to these categories as well.
        filter (str):
            The filtering expression. This can be used to
            restrict search results based on Product labels.
            We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
            expressions, where each expression within an OR
            must have the same key. An '=' should be used to
            connect the key and value.

            For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND
            brand = Google" is acceptable, but "(color = red
            OR brand = Google)" is not acceptable. "color:
            red" is not acceptable because it uses a ':'
            instead of an '='.
