class ChannelConnection(proto.Message):
    r"""A representation of the ChannelConnection resource.
    A ChannelConnection is a resource which event providers create
    during the activation process to establish a connection between
    the provider and the subscriber channel.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The name of the connection.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server assigned ID of the
            resource. The server guarantees uniqueness and
            immutability until deleted.
        channel (str):
            Required. The name of the connected subscriber Channel. This
            is a weak reference to avoid cross project and cross
            accounts references. This must be in
            ``projects/{project}/location/{location}/channels/{channel_id}``
            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The creation time.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last-modified time.
        activation_token (str):
            Input only. Activation token for the channel.
            The token will be used during the creation of
            ChannelConnection to bind the channel with the
            provider project. This field will not be stored
            in the provider resource.
