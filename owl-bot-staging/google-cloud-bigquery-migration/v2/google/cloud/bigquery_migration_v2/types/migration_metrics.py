    Attributes:

            Required. The name of the metric.

            If the metric is not known by the service yet,
            it will be auto-created.
        value_type (google.api.metric_pb2.ValueType):

        metric_kind (google.api.metric_pb2.MetricKind):
            Optional. The metric kind of the time series.

            If present, it must be the same as the metric kind of the
            associated metric. If the associated metric's descriptor
            must be auto-created, then this field specifies the metric
            kind of the new descriptor and must be either ``GAUGE`` (the

            Required. The data points of this time series. When listing
            time series, points are returned in reverse time order.

            When creating a time series, this field must contain exactly
            one point and the point's type must be the same as the value
            type of the associated metric. If the associated metric's
            descriptor must be auto-created, then the value type of the
            descriptor is determined by the point's type, which must be
            ``BOOL``, ``INT64``, ``DOUBLE``, or ``DISTRIBUTION``.
