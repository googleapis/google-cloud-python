class Viewport(proto.Message):
    r"""A latitude-longitude viewport, represented as two diagonally
    opposite ``low`` and ``high`` points. A viewport is considered a
    closed region, i.e. it includes its boundary. The latitude bounds
    must range between -90 to 90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude
    bounds must range between -180 to 180 degrees inclusive. Various
    cases include:

    -  If ``low`` = ``high``, the viewport consists of that single
       point.

    -  If ``low.longitude`` > ``high.longitude``, the longitude range is
       inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line).

    -  If ``low.longitude`` = -180 degrees and ``high.longitude`` = 180
       degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes.

    -  If ``low.longitude`` = 180 degrees and ``high.longitude`` = -180
       degrees, the longitude range is empty.

    -  If ``low.latitude`` > ``high.latitude``, the latitude range is
       empty.

    Both ``low`` and ``high`` must be populated, and the represented box
    cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions above). An empty
    viewport will result in an error.

    For example, this viewport fully encloses New York City:

    { "low": { "latitude": 40.477398, "longitude": -74.259087 }, "high":
    { "latitude": 40.91618, "longitude": -73.70018 } }

    Attributes:
        low (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            Required. The low point of the viewport.
        high (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            Required. The high point of the viewport.
