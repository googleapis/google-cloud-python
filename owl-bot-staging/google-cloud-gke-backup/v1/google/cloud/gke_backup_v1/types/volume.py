class VolumeBackup(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents the backup of a specific persistent volume as a
    component of a Backup - both the record of the operation and a
    pointer to the underlying storage-specific artifacts.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. The full name of the VolumeBackup resource.
            Format:
            ``projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*/backups/*/volumeBackups/*``.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of
            `UUID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__
            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            VolumeBackup resource was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            VolumeBackup resource was last updated.
        source_pvc (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.NamespacedName):
            Output only. A reference to the source
            Kubernetes PVC from which this VolumeBackup was
            created.
        volume_backup_handle (str):
            Output only. A storage system-specific opaque
            handle to the underlying volume backup.
        format_ (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.VolumeBackup.VolumeBackupFormat):
            Output only. The format used for the volume
            backup.
        storage_bytes (int):
            Output only. The aggregate size of the
            underlying artifacts associated with this
            VolumeBackup in the backup storage. This may
            change over time when multiple backups of the
            same volume share the same backup storage
            location. In particular, this is likely to
            increase in size when the immediately preceding
            backup of the same volume is deleted.
        disk_size_bytes (int):
            Output only. The minimum size of the disk to
            which this VolumeBackup can be restored.
        complete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the
            associated underlying volume backup operation
            completed.
        state (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.VolumeBackup.State):
            Output only. The current state of this
            VolumeBackup.
        state_message (str):
            Output only. A human readable message
            explaining why the VolumeBackup is in its
            current state.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            volume backup from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the ``etag`` in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform volume backup updates in
            order to avoid race conditions.
