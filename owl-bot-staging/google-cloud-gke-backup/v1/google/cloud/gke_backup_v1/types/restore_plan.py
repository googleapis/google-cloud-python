class RestorePlan(proto.Message):
    r"""The configuration of a potential series of Restore operations
    to be performed against Backups belong to a particular
    BackupPlan.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. The full name of the RestorePlan resource.
            Format: ``projects/*/locations/*/restorePlans/*``.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of
            `UUID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__
            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            RestorePlan resource was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            RestorePlan resource was last updated.
        description (str):
            Optional. User specified descriptive string
            for this RestorePlan.
        backup_plan (str):
            Required. Immutable. A reference to the
            [BackupPlan][google.cloud.gkebackup.v1.BackupPlan] from
            which Backups may be used as the source for Restores created
            via this RestorePlan. Format:
            ``projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*``.
        cluster (str):
            Required. Immutable. The target cluster into which Restores
            created via this RestorePlan will restore data. NOTE: the
            cluster's region must be the same as the RestorePlan. Valid
            formats:

            -  ``projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*``
            -  ``projects/*/zones/*/clusters/*``
        restore_config (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.RestoreConfig):
            Required. Configuration of Restores created
            via this RestorePlan.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by
            user.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            restore from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the ``etag`` in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order
            to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in the
            response to ``GetRestorePlan``, and systems are expected to
            put that etag in the request to ``UpdateRestorePlan`` or
            ``DeleteRestorePlan`` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the resource.
        state (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.RestorePlan.State):
            Output only. State of the RestorePlan. This
            State field reflects the various stages a
            RestorePlan can be in during the Create
            operation.
        state_reason (str):
            Output only. Human-readable description of why RestorePlan
            is in the current ``state``
    """
    class State(proto.Enum):
        r"""State

        Values:
            STATE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Default first value for Enums.
            CLUSTER_PENDING (1):
                Waiting for cluster state to be RUNNING.
            READY (2):
                The RestorePlan has successfully been created
                and is ready for Restores.
            FAILED (3):
                RestorePlan creation has failed.
            DELETING (4):
