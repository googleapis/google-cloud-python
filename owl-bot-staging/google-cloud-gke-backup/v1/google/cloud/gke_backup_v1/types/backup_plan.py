    Backups.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. The full name of the BackupPlan resource.
            Format: ``projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*``
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of

            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            BackupPlan resource was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            BackupPlan resource was last updated.
        description (str):
            Optional. User specified descriptive string
            for this BackupPlan.
        cluster (str):
            Required. Immutable. The source cluster from which Backups
            will be created via this BackupPlan. Valid formats:

            -  ``projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*``
            -  ``projects/*/zones/*/clusters/*``
        retention_policy (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.RetentionPolicy):
            Optional. RetentionPolicy governs lifecycle
            of Backups created under this plan.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by
            user.
        backup_schedule (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.Schedule):
            Optional. Defines a schedule for automatic
            Backup creation via this BackupPlan.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            backup plan from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates in
            order to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in
            the response to ``GetBackupPlan``, and systems are expected
            to put that etag in the request to ``UpdateBackupPlan`` or
            ``DeleteBackupPlan`` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the resource.
        deactivated (bool):
            Optional. This flag indicates whether this
            BackupPlan has been deactivated. Setting this
            field to True locks the BackupPlan such that no
            further updates will be allowed (except
            deletes), including the deactivated field
            itself. It also prevents any new Backups from
            being created via this BackupPlan (including
            scheduled Backups).

            Default: False
        backup_config (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.BackupConfig):
            Optional. Defines the configuration of
            Backups created via this BackupPlan.
        protected_pod_count (int):
            Output only. The number of Kubernetes Pods
            backed up in the last successful Backup created
            via this BackupPlan.
        state (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.State):
            Output only. State of the BackupPlan. This
            State field reflects the various stages a
            BackupPlan can be in during the Create
            operation. It will be set to "DEACTIVATED" if
            the BackupPlan is deactivated on an Update
        state_reason (str):
            Output only. Human-readable description of why BackupPlan is
            in the current ``state``
        rpo_risk_level (int):
            Output only. A number that represents the
            current risk level of this BackupPlan from RPO
            perspective with 1 being no risk and 5 being
            highest risk.
        rpo_risk_reason (str):
            Output only. Human-readable description of why the
            BackupPlan is in the current rpo_risk_level and action items
            if any.

class ExclusionWindow(proto.Message):
    r"""Defines a time window during which no backup should
    happen. All time and date are in UTC.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        start_time (google.type.timeofday_pb2.TimeOfDay):
            Required. Specifies the start time of the
            window using time of the day in UTC.
        duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Required. Specifies duration of the window. Duration must be
            >= 5 minutes and < (target RPO - 20 minutes). Additional
            restrictions based on the recurrence type to allow some time
            for backup to happen:

            -  single_occurrence_date: no restriction, but UI may warn
               about this when duration >= target RPO
            -  daily window: duration < 24 hours
            -  weekly window:

               -  days of week includes all seven days of a week:
                  duration < 24 hours
               -  all other weekly window: duration < 168 hours (i.e.,
                  24 \* 7 hours)
        single_occurrence_date (google.type.date_pb2.Date):
            No recurrence. The exclusion window occurs
            only once and on this date in UTC.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``recurrence``.
        daily (bool):
            The exclusion window occurs every day if set
            to "True". Specifying this field to "False" is
            an error.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``recurrence``.
        days_of_week (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.ExclusionWindow.DayOfWeekList):
            The exclusion window occurs on these days of
            each week in UTC.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``recurrence``.
