            User specified descriptive string for this
            Restore.
        backup (str):
            Required. Immutable. A reference to the
            [Backup][google.cloud.gkebackup.v1.Backup] used as the
            source from which this Restore will restore. Note that this
            Backup must be a sub-resource of the RestorePlan's
            [backup_plan][google.cloud.gkebackup.v1.RestorePlan.backup_plan].
            Format: ``projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*/backups/*``.

            why the Restore is in its current state.
        complete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp of when the restore
            operation completed.

            Output only. Number of volumes restored
            during the restore execution.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            restore from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the ``etag`` in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order
            to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in the
            response to ``GetRestore``, and systems are expected to put
            that etag in the request to ``UpdateRestore`` or
            ``DeleteRestore`` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the resource.
        filter (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.Restore.Filter):
            Optional. Immutable. Filters resources for ``Restore``. If

            ``MERGE_REPLACE_ON_CONFLICT``.
        volume_data_restore_policy_overrides (MutableSequence[google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.VolumeDataRestorePolicyOverride]):

                This mode merges the backup and the target
                cluster and skips the conflicting resources. If
                a single resource to restore exists in the

                skipped, otherwise it will be restored.

                This mode merges the backup and the target cluster and skips
                the conflicting resources except volume data. If a PVC to
                restore already exists, this mode will restore/reconnect the
                volume without overwriting the PVC. It is similar to
                MERGE_SKIP_ON_CONFLICT except that it will apply the volume
                data policy for the conflicting PVCs:

                -  RESTORE_VOLUME_DATA_FROM_BACKUP: restore data only and
                   respect the reclaim policy of the original PV;
                -  REUSE_VOLUME_HANDLE_FROM_BACKUP: reconnect and respect
                   the reclaim policy of the original PV;
                -  NO_VOLUME_DATA_RESTORATION: new provision and respect the
                   reclaim policy of the original PV. Note that this mode
                   could cause data loss as the original PV can be retained
                   or deleted depending on its reclaim policy.
            MERGE_REPLACE_ON_CONFLICT (5):
                This mode merges the backup and the target
                cluster and replaces the conflicting resources
                with the ones in the backup. If a single
                resource to restore exists in the cluster before
                restoration, the resource will be replaced with
                the one from the backup. To replace an existing
                resource, the first attempt is to update the
                resource to match the one from the backup; if
                the update fails, the second attempt is to
                delete the resource and restore it from the
                backup.
                Note that this mode could cause data loss as it
                replaces the existing resources in the target
