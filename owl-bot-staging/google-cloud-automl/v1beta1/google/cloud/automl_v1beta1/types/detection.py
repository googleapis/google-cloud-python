            AnnotationSpec) when multiple are present on a
            single example.
            NOTE: Instance ID prediction quality is not a
            part of model evaluation and is done as best
            effort. Especially in cases when an entity goes
            off-screen for a longer time (minutes), when it
            comes back it may be given a new instance ID.

            Required. A time (frame) of a video to which
            this annotation pertains. Represented as the
            duration since the video's start.
        bounding_box (google.cloud.automl_v1beta1.types.BoundingPoly):
            Required. The rectangle representing the object location on
            the frame (i.e. at the time_offset of the video).
        score (float):
            Output only. The confidence that this annotation is positive
            for the video at the time_offset, value in [0, 1], higher
            means higher positivity confidence. For annotations created
            by the user the score is 1. When user approves an

            changed to 1).
