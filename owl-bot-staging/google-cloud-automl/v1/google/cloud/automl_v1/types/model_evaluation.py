class ModelEvaluation(proto.Message):
    r"""Evaluation results of a model.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        classification_evaluation_metrics (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.ClassificationEvaluationMetrics):
            Model evaluation metrics for image, text,
            video and tables classification.
            Tables problem is considered a classification
            when the target column is CATEGORY DataType.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``metrics``.
        translation_evaluation_metrics (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.TranslationEvaluationMetrics):
            Model evaluation metrics for translation.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``metrics``.
        image_object_detection_evaluation_metrics (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.ImageObjectDetectionEvaluationMetrics):
            Model evaluation metrics for image object
            detection.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``metrics``.
        text_sentiment_evaluation_metrics (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.TextSentimentEvaluationMetrics):
            Evaluation metrics for text sentiment models.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``metrics``.
        text_extraction_evaluation_metrics (google.cloud.automl_v1.types.TextExtractionEvaluationMetrics):
            Evaluation metrics for text extraction
            models.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``metrics``.
        name (str):
            Output only. Resource name of the model evaluation. Format:
            ``projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/models/{model_id}/modelEvaluations/{model_evaluation_id}``
        annotation_spec_id (str):
            Output only. The ID of the annotation spec that the model
            evaluation applies to. The The ID is empty for the overall
            model evaluation. For Tables annotation specs in the dataset
            do not exist and this ID is always not set, but for
            CLASSIFICATION
            [prediction_type-s][google.cloud.automl.v1.TablesModelMetadata.prediction_type]
            the
            [display_name][google.cloud.automl.v1.ModelEvaluation.display_name]
            field is used.
        display_name (str):
            Output only. The value of
            [display_name][google.cloud.automl.v1.AnnotationSpec.display_name]
            at the moment when the model was trained. Because this field
            returns a value at model training time, for different models
            trained from the same dataset, the values may differ, since
            display names could had been changed between the two model's
            trainings. For Tables CLASSIFICATION
            [prediction_type-s][google.cloud.automl.v1.TablesModelMetadata.prediction_type]
            distinct values of the target column at the moment of the
            model evaluation are populated here. The display_name is
            empty for the overall model evaluation.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this model
            evaluation was created.
        evaluated_example_count (int):
            Output only. The number of examples used for model
            evaluation, i.e. for which ground truth from time of model
            creation is compared against the predicted annotations
            created by the model. For overall ModelEvaluation (i.e. with
            annotation_spec_id not set) this is the total number of all
            examples used for evaluation. Otherwise, this is the count
            of examples that according to the ground truth were
            annotated by the
            [annotation_spec_id][google.cloud.automl.v1.ModelEvaluation.annotation_spec_id].
