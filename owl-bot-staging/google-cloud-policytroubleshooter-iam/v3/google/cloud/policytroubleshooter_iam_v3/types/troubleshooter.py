            Required. Indicates whether *this rule* denies the specified
            permission to the specified principal for the specified
            resource.

            This field does *not* indicate whether the principal is
            actually denied on the permission for the resource. There
            might be another rule that overrides this rule. To determine

            the permission in the request.

            Each key identifies a denied permission in the

            matches the permission in the request.

            Each key identifies a exception permission in

            Lists all denied principals in the deny rule
            and indicates whether each principal matches the
            principal in the request, either directly or
            through membership in a principal set.

            Each key identifies a denied principal in the
            rule, and each value indicates whether the
            denied principal matches the principal in the
            request.
        combined_exception_principal (google.cloud.policytroubleshooter_iam_v3.types.DenyRuleExplanation.AnnotatedDenyPrincipalMatching):

            directly or through membership in a principal
            set.

            Each key identifies a exception principal in the

        condition (google.type.expr_pb2.Expr):
            A condition expression that specifies when
