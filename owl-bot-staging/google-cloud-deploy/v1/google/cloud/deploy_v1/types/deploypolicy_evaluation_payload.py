    event that describes the deploy policy evaluation event.

    Attributes:
        message (str):
            Debug message for when a deploy policy event
            occurs.
        rule_type (str):
            Rule type (e.g. Restrict Rollouts).
        rule (str):
            Rule id.
        pipeline_uid (str):
            Unique identifier of the ``Delivery Pipeline``.
        delivery_pipeline (str):
            The name of the ``Delivery Pipeline``.
        target_uid (str):
            Unique identifier of the ``Target``. This is an optional
            field, as a ``Target`` may not always be applicable to a
            policy.
        target (str):
            The name of the ``Target``. This is an optional field, as a
            ``Target`` may not always be applicable to a policy.
        invoker (google.cloud.deploy_v1.types.DeployPolicy.Invoker):
            What invoked the action (e.g. a user or
            automation).
        deploy_policy (str):
            The name of the ``DeployPolicy``.
        deploy_policy_uid (str):
            Unique identifier of the ``DeployPolicy``.
        allowed (bool):
            Whether the request is allowed. Allowed is
            set as true if: (1) the request complies with
            the policy; or (2) the request doesn't comply
            with the policy but the policy was overridden;
            or
            (3) the request doesn't comply with the policy
            but the policy was suspended
        verdict (google.cloud.deploy_v1.types.DeployPolicyEvaluationEvent.PolicyVerdict):
            The policy verdict of the request.
        overrides (MutableSequence[google.cloud.deploy_v1.types.DeployPolicyEvaluationEvent.PolicyVerdictOverride]):
            Things that could have overridden the policy
            verdict. Overrides together with verdict decide
            whether the request is allowed.
