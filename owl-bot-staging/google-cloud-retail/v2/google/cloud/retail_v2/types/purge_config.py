            Required. The resource name of the branch under which the

            Empty string filter is not allowed. "*" implies delete all
            items in a branch.

            The eligible fields for filtering are:

            -  ``availability``: Double quoted
               [Product.availability][google.cloud.retail.v2.Product.availability]
               string.
            -  ``create_time`` : in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.

            Supported syntax:

            -  Comparators (">", "<", ">=", "<=", "="). Examples:

               -  create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z"
               -  availability = "IN_STOCK"

            -  Conjunctions ("AND") Examples:

                  = "PREORDER"

                  = "IN_STOCK"

            -  Filter Limits:

               -  Filter should not contain more than 6 conditions.
               -  Max nesting depth should not exceed 2 levels.

            Examples queries:

            -  Delete back order products created before a timestamp.
               create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability =

            -  ``userId``: Double quoted string. Specifying this will
               delete all events associated with a user.
