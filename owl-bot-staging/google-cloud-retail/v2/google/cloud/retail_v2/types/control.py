class Control(proto.Message):
    r"""Configures dynamic metadata that can be linked to a
    [ServingConfig][google.cloud.retail.v2.ServingConfig] and affect
    search or recommendation results at serving time.

    Attributes:
        rule (google.cloud.retail_v2.types.Rule):
            A rule control - a condition-action pair.
            Enacts a set action when the condition is
            triggered. For example: Boost "gShoe" when query
            full matches "Running Shoes".

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``control``.
        name (str):
            Immutable. Fully qualified name
            ``projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/*/controls/*``
        display_name (str):
            Required. The human readable control display name. Used in
            Retail UI.

            This field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length
            limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is thrown.
        associated_serving_config_ids (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. List of [serving
            config][google.cloud.retail.v2.ServingConfig] ids that are
            associated with this control in the same
            [Catalog][google.cloud.retail.v2.Catalog].

            Note the association is managed via the
            [ServingConfig][google.cloud.retail.v2.ServingConfig], this
            is an output only denormalized view.
        solution_types (MutableSequence[google.cloud.retail_v2.types.SolutionType]):
            Required. Immutable. The solution types that the control is
            used for. Currently we support setting only one type of
            solution at creation time.

            Only ``SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH`` value is supported at the
            moment. If no solution type is provided at creation time,
            will default to
            [SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH][google.cloud.retail.v2.SolutionType.SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH].
        search_solution_use_case (MutableSequence[google.cloud.retail_v2.types.SearchSolutionUseCase]):
            Specifies the use case for the control. Affects what
            condition fields can be set. Only settable by search
            controls. Will default to
            [SEARCH_SOLUTION_USE_CASE_SEARCH][google.cloud.retail.v2.SearchSolutionUseCase.SEARCH_SOLUTION_USE_CASE_SEARCH]
            if not specified. Currently only allow one
            search_solution_use_case per control.
