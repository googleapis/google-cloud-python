    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

        max_results (int):

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.

            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or

            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The

            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_page_token``.

        return_partial_success (bool):
            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no
            resources, with an error code.

        service_project_number (int):

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is
            expected to be found will be included.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on

        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

        max_results (int):

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is
            expected to be found will be included.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_page_token``.
        project (str):
            Name of the project scoping this request.
        return_partial_success (bool):
            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no
            resources, with an error code.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_return_partial_success``.
        service_project_number (int):

            project number for which aggregated list request

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for
            each scope type (zone, region, global) should be
            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is
            expected to be found will be included.

            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do

            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        include_all_scopes (bool):
            Indicates whether every visible scope for

            included in the response. For new resource types
            added after this field, the flag has no effect
            as new resource types will always include every
            visible scope for each scope type in response.
            For resource types which predate this field, if
            this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of
            the scope types where the resource type is

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by

            [Output Only] The architecture of the attached disk. Valid
            values are ARM64 or X86_64. Check the Architecture enum for
            the list of possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_architecture``.
        auto_delete (bool):
            Specifies whether the disk will be

            not when the disk is detached from the
            instance).

        boot (bool):
            Indicates that this is a boot disk. The

            the disk for its root filesystem.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_boot``.

            reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-\* tree of a Linux
            operating system running within the instance. This name can
            be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and

            server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk,
            in the form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned
            by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for
            persistent disks.

        disk_encryption_key (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.CustomerEncryptionKey):
            Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a

            creating a new disk, this field encrypts the new
            disk using an encryption key that you provide.
            If you are attaching an existing disk that is
            already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
            using the customer-supplied encryption key. If
            you encrypt a disk using a customer-supplied
            key, you must provide the same key again when
            you attempt to use this resource at a later
            time. For example, you must provide the key when
            you create a snapshot or an image from the disk
            or when you attach the disk to a virtual machine
            instance. If you do not provide an encryption
            key, then the disk will be encrypted using an
            automatically generated key and you do not need
            to provide a key to use the disk later. Instance
            templates do not store customer-supplied
            encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys

            to force attach a zonal disk to an instance, you will

            operating system. Applicable only for bootable
            images. Read Enabling guest operating system
            features to see a list of available options.
        index (int):
            [Output Only] A zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is
            reserved for the boot disk. If you have many disks attached
            to an instance, each disk would have a unique index number.

            will be created alongside the new instance. Use
            initialization parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs
            attached to the new instance. This property is mutually

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_shielded_instance_initial_state``.
        source (str):
            Specifies a valid partial or full URL to an

    r"""[Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will be
    created alongside the new instance. Use initialization parameters to
    create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new instance. This
    field is persisted and returned for instanceTemplate and not
    returned in the context of instance. This property is mutually

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        architecture (str):
            The architecture of the attached disk. Valid values are
            arm64 or x86_64. Check the Architecture enum for the list of
            possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_architecture``.
        description (str):
            An optional description. Provide this
            property when creating the disk.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_description``.
        disk_name (str):
            Specifies the disk name. If not specified,
            the default is to use the name of the instance.
            If a disk with the same name already exists in
            the given region, the existing disk is attached
            to the new instance and the new disk is not
            created.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_disk_name``.
        disk_size_gb (int):
            Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.
            The size must be at least 10 GB. If you specify
            a sourceImage, which is required for boot disks,
            the default size is the size of the sourceImage.
            If you do not specify a sourceImage, the default
            disk size is 500 GB.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_disk_size_gb``.
        disk_type (str):
            Specifies the disk type to use to create the
            instance. If not specified, the default is
            pd-standard, specified using the full URL. For
            example:
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
            /diskTypes/pd-standard For a full list of
            acceptable values, see Persistent disk types. If
            you specify this field when creating a VM, you
            can provide either the full or partial URL. For
            example, the following values are valid: -
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
            /diskTypes/diskType -
            projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType -
            zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType If you specify
            this field when creating or updating an instance
            template or all-instances configuration, specify
            the type of the disk, not the URL. For example:
            pd-standard.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_disk_type``.
        enable_confidential_compute (bool):
            Whether this disk is using confidential
            compute mode.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_enable_confidential_compute``.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels to apply to this disk. These can be
            later modified by the disks.setLabels method.
            This field is only applicable for persistent
            disks.
        licenses (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of publicly visible licenses. Reserved
            for Google's use.
        on_update_action (str):
            Specifies which action to take on instance
            update with this disk. Default is to use the
            existing disk. Check the OnUpdateAction enum for
            the list of possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_on_update_action``.
        provisioned_iops (int):
            Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the
            disk. This sets the number of I/O operations per
            second that the disk can handle. Values must be
            between 10,000 and 120,000. For more details,
            see the Extreme persistent disk documentation.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_provisioned_iops``.
        provisioned_throughput (int):
            Indicates how much throughput to provision
            for the disk. This sets the number of throughput
            mb per second that the disk can handle. Values
            must greater than or equal to 1.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_provisioned_throughput``.
        replica_zones (MutableSequence[str]):
            Required for each regional disk associated
            with the instance. Specify the URLs of the zones
            where the disk should be replicated to. You must
            provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone
            must be the same as the instance zone.
        resource_manager_tags (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Resource manager tags to be bound to the disk. Tag keys and
            values have the same definition as resource manager tags.
            Keys must be in the format ``tagKeys/{tag_key_id}``, and
            values are in the format ``tagValues/456``. The field is
            ignored (both PUT & PATCH) when empty.
        resource_policies (MutableSequence[str]):
            Resource policies applied to this disk for
            automatic snapshot creations. Specified using
            the full or partial URL. For instance template,
            specify only the resource policy name.
        source_image (str):
            The source image to create this disk. When
            creating a new instance, one of
            initializeParams.sourceImage or
            initializeParams.sourceSnapshot or disks.source
            is required except for local SSD. To create a
            disk with one of the public operating system
            images, specify the image by its family name.
            For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the
            latest Debian 9 image:
            projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
            Alternatively, use a specific version of a
            public operating system image:
            projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD
            To create a disk with a custom image that you
            created, specify the image name in the following
            format: global/images/my-custom-image You can
            also specify a custom image by its image family,
            which returns the latest version of the image in
            that family. Replace the image name with
            family/family-name:
            global/images/family/my-image-family If the
            source image is deleted later, this field will
            not be set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_image``.
        source_image_encryption_key (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.CustomerEncryptionKey):
            The customer-supplied encryption key of the
            source image. Required if the source image is
            protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
            InstanceTemplate and InstancePropertiesPatch do
            not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so
            you cannot create disks for instances in a
            managed instance group if the source images are
            encrypted with your own keys.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_image_encryption_key``.
        source_snapshot (str):
            The source snapshot to create this disk. When
            creating a new instance, one of
            initializeParams.sourceSnapshot or
            initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is
            required except for local SSD. To create a disk
            with a snapshot that you created, specify the
            snapshot name in the following format:
            global/snapshots/my-backup If the source
            snapshot is deleted later, this field will not
            be set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_snapshot``.
        source_snapshot_encryption_key (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.CustomerEncryptionKey):
            The customer-supplied encryption key of the
            source snapshot.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_snapshot_encryption_key``.
        storage_pool (str):
            The storage pool in which the new disk is
            created. You can provide this as a partial or
            full URL to the resource. For example, the
            following are valid values: -
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
            /storagePools/storagePool -

            Specifying an accurate initialization period improves
            autoscaler decisions. For example, when scaling out, the
            autoscaler ignores data from VMs that are still initializing
            because those VMs might not yet represent normal usage of
            your application. The default initialization period is 60
            seconds. Initialization periods might vary because of
            numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long your
            application takes to initialize. To do this, create a VM and

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring
            filter string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is
            used to select a specific TimeSeries for the purpose of
            autoscaling and to determine whether the metric is exporting
            per-instance or per-group data. For the filter to be valid
            for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply: - You
            can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You
            can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
            any functions for each selector. - You can specify the
            metric in both the filter string and in the metric field.
            However, if specified in both places, the metric must be
            identical. - The monitored resource type determines what
            kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a
            gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a
            separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a
            case, you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource
            type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric
            to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
            instance group and resource label filtering can be performed
            to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
            This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of
            autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to
            gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective
            enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group
            or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance
            resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon the
            query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective
            values to obtain its scaling value.

        metric (str):
            The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver

        single_instance_assignment (float):
            If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that
            represents the total amount of work to be done or resource
            usage, set this value to an amount assigned for a single
            instance of the scaled group. Autoscaler keeps the number of
            instances proportional to the value of this metric. The
            metric itself does not change value due to group resizing. A
            good metric to use with the target is for example
            pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
            or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests
            coming to your instances. A bad example would be a metric
            exporting an average or median latency, since this value
            can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance, it
            could be better used with utilization_target instead.

            Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache
            content. Responses without these headers will not be cached
            at Google's edge, and will require a full trip to the origin
            on every request, potentially impacting performance and
            increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache
            all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
            "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers.
            Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private,

            and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as

        client_ttl (int):
            Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum
            TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value
            sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of
            client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age
            directive, along with a "public" directive. For cacheable
            content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the
            max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the
            response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl
            and default_ttl, and also ensures a "public" cache-control
            directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a
            default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_client_ttl``.
        default_ttl (int):
            Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
            origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
            (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always
            revalidate". The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a
            value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When
            the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will
            overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently
            accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the
            defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_default_ttl``.
        max_ttl (int):
            Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached
            content served by this origin. Cache directives
            that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher
            than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL
            seconds in the future will be capped at the
            value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an
            s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent
            to the client will not be modified. Setting a
            TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The
            maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year),
            noting that infrequently accessed objects may be
            evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_ttl``.
        negative_caching (bool):
            Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in
            order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
            redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and
            improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
            When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or
            USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses
            with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When
            the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching
            applies to all responses with the specified response code,
            and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will
            apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP
            300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m
            HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal
            Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected
            Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be
            overridden in negative_caching_policy.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_negative_caching``.
        negative_caching_policy (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendBucketCdnPolicyNegativeCachingPolicy]):
            Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code.
            negative_caching must be enabled to configure
            negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
            negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache
            TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit
            negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a
            cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache.
            Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
            policy exists.
        request_coalescing (bool):
            If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple
            concurrent cache fill requests into a small
            number of requests to the origin.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_request_coalescing``.
        serve_while_stale (int):
            Serve existing content from the cache (if
            available) when revalidating content with the
            origin, or when an error is encountered when
            refreshing the cache. This setting defines the
            default "max-stale" duration for any cached
            responses that do not specify a max-stale
            directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
            configured here will not be served. The default
            limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
            allow stale content to be served up to this
            limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a
            cached response. The maximum allowed value is
            604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable
            serve-while-stale.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_serve_while_stale``.
        signed_url_cache_max_age_sec (int):
            Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL
            request will be considered fresh. After this time period,
            the response will be revalidated before being served.
            Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to signed
            URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all
            responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public,
            max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing
            Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
            will not be altered.

            an example of how to use this field, see Define a list of
            preferred policies. Caution: This field and its children are
            intended for use in a service mesh that includes gRPC
            clients only. Envoy proxies can't use backend services that
            have this configuration.
        locality_lb_policy (str):
            The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the
            locality. The possible values are: - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a
            simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in
            round robin order. This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An
            O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and
            picks the host which has fewer active requests. - RING_HASH:
            The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
            hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
            addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only
            affects 1/N of the requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer
            selects a random healthy host. - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION:
            Backend host is selected based on the client connection
            metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address
            as the destination address of the incoming connection before
            the connection was redirected to the load balancer. -
            MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load
            balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has
            faster table lookup build times and host selection times.
            For more information about Maglev, see
            https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is
            applicable to either: - A regional backend service with the
            service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
            load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global
            backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to
            INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or
            EXTERNAL_MANAGED. If sessionAffinity is not NONE, and this
            field is not set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH, session affinity

        max_stream_duration (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.Duration):
            Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams
            to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of
            the stream until the response has been completely processed,
            including all retries. A stream that does not complete in
            this duration is closed. If not specified, there will be no
            timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite. This
            value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of
            the UrlMap that references this backend service. This field
            is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend

            read by the backend RCTH
        name (str):
            Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

        outlier_detection (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.OutlierDetection):
            Settings controlling the ejection of unhealthy backend
            endpoints from the load balancing pool of each individual
            proxy instance that processes the traffic for the given
            backend service. If not set, this feature is considered
            disabled. Results of the outlier detection algorithm
            (ejection of endpoints from the load balancing pool and
            returning them back to the pool) are executed independently
            by each proxy instance of the load balancer. In most cases,
            more than one proxy instance handles the traffic received by
            a backend service. Thus, it is possible that an unhealthy
            endpoint is detected and ejected by only some of the
            proxies, and while this happens, other proxies may continue
            to send requests to the same unhealthy endpoint until they
            detect and eject the unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend
            endpoints can be: - VM instances in an Instance Group -
            Endpoints in a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP, GCE_VM_IP_PORT) -
            Endpoints in a Hybrid Connectivity NEG
            (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) - Serverless NEGs, that resolve to
            Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private
            Service Connect NEGs, that resolve to Google-managed
            regional API endpoints or managed services published using
            Private Service Connect Applicable backend service types can
            be: - A global backend service with the loadBalancingScheme
            set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. - A
            regional backend service with the serviceProtocol set to
            HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and loadBalancingScheme set to
            INTERNAL_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Not supported for
            Serverless NEGs. Not supported when the backend service is

        Values:
            UNDEFINED_SESSION_AFFINITY (0):
                A value indicating that the enum field is not
                set.
            CLIENT_IP (345665051):
                2-tuple hash on packet's source and
                destination IP addresses. Connections from the
                same source IP address to the same destination
                IP address will be served by the same backend VM
                while that VM remains healthy.
            CLIENT_IP_NO_DESTINATION (106122516):
                1-tuple hash only on packet's source IP
                address. Connections from the same source IP
                address will be served by the same backend VM
                while that VM remains healthy. This option can
                only be used for Internal TCP/UDP Load
                Balancing.
            CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO (221722926):
                5-tuple hash on packet's source and
                destination IP addresses, IP protocol, and
                source and destination ports. Connections for
                the same IP protocol from the same source IP
                address and port to the same destination IP
                address and port will be served by the same
                backend VM while that VM remains healthy. This
                option cannot be used for HTTP(S) load
                balancing.
            CLIENT_IP_PROTO (25322148):
                3-tuple hash on packet's source and
                destination IP addresses, and IP protocol.
                Connections for the same IP protocol from the
                same source IP address to the same destination
                IP address will be served by the same backend VM
                while that VM remains healthy. This option
                cannot be used for HTTP(S) load balancing.
            GENERATED_COOKIE (370321204):
                Hash based on a cookie generated by the L7
                loadbalancer. Only valid for HTTP(S) load
                balancing.
            HEADER_FIELD (200737960):
                The hash is based on a user specified header
                field.
            HTTP_COOKIE (494981627):
                The hash is based on a user provided cookie.
            NONE (2402104):
                No session affinity. Connections from the
                same client IP may go to any instance in the
                pool.

            Bypass the cache when the specified request
            headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cache_key_policy``.
        cache_mode (str):
            Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
            backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
            Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache
            content. Responses without these headers will not be cached
            at Google's edge, and will require a full trip to the origin
            on every request, potentially impacting performance and
            increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache
            all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
            "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers.
            Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private,
            per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
            Automatically cache static content, including common image
            formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript
            and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
            uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML),
            will not be cached. Check the CacheMode enum for the list of
            possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cache_mode``.
        client_ttl (int):
            Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum
            TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value
            sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of
            client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age
            directive, along with a "public" directive. For cacheable
            content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the
            max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the
            response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl
            and default_ttl, and also ensures a "public" cache-control
            directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a
            default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_client_ttl``.
        default_ttl (int):
            Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
            origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
            (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always
            revalidate". The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a
            value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When
            the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will
            overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed
            value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently
            accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the
            defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_default_ttl``.
        max_ttl (int):
            Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached
            content served by this origin. Cache directives
            that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher
            than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL
            seconds in the future will be capped at the
            value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an
            s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent
            to the client will not be modified. Setting a
            TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The
            maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year),
            noting that infrequently accessed objects may be
            evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_ttl``.
        negative_caching (bool):
            Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in
            order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
            redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and
            improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
            When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or
            USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses
            with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When
            the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching
            applies to all responses with the specified response code,
            and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will
            apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP
            300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m
            HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal
            Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected
            Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be
            overridden in negative_caching_policy.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_negative_caching``.
        negative_caching_policy (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.BackendServiceCdnPolicyNegativeCachingPolicy]):
            Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code.
            negative_caching must be enabled to configure
            negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
            negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache
            TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit
            negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a
            cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache.
            Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
            policy exists.
        request_coalescing (bool):
            If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple
            concurrent cache fill requests into a small

            origin, or when an error is encountered when
            refreshing the cache. This setting defines the
            default "max-stale" duration for any cached
            responses that do not specify a max-stale
            directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
            configured here will not be served. The default
            limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
            allow stale content to be served up to this
            limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a
            cached response. The maximum allowed value is
            604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_disk``.
        source_disk_id (str):
            [Output Only] The unique ID of the disk used to create this
            disk. This value identifies the exact disk that was used to
            create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the
            persistent disk from a disk that was later deleted and
            recreated under the same name, the source disk ID would
            identify the exact version of the disk that was used.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_disk_id``.
        source_image (str):
            The source image used to create this disk. If
            the source image is deleted, this field will not
            be set. To create a disk with one of the public
            operating system images, specify the image by
            its family name. For example, specify
            family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9
            image:
            projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
            Alternatively, use a specific version of a
            public operating system image:
            projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD
            To create a disk with a custom image that you
            created, specify the image name in the following
            format: global/images/my-custom-image You can
            also specify a custom image by its image family,
            which returns the latest version of the image in
            that family. Replace the image name with
            family/family-name:
            global/images/family/my-image-family

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_image``.

            protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_source_image_encryption_key``.
        source_image_id (str):
            [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this
            disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to
            create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the
            persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and
            recreated under the same name, the source image ID would
            identify the exact version of the image that was used.

            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?``. The first character must be
            a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for
            the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or
            digit. The last character must be a lowercase letter or
            digit.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        network (str):
            URL of the network resource for this firewall
            rule. If not specified when creating a firewall
            rule, the default network is used:
            global/networks/default If you choose to specify
            this field, you can specify the network as a
            full or partial URL. For example, the following
            are all valid URLs: -
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network
            - projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network
            - global/networks/default

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_network``.
        priority (int):
            Priority for this rule. This is an integer between ``0`` and
            ``65535``, both inclusive. The default value is ``1000``.
            Relative priorities determine which rule takes effect if
            multiple rules apply. Lower values indicate higher priority.
            For example, a rule with priority ``0`` has higher
            precedence than a rule with priority ``1``. DENY rules take
            precedence over ALLOW rules if they have equal priority.
            Note that VPC networks have implied rules with a priority of
            ``65535``. To avoid conflicts with the implied rules, use a
            priority number less than ``65535``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_priority``.
        self_link (str):
            [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_self_link``.
        source_ranges (MutableSequence[str]):
            If source ranges are specified, the firewall
            rule applies only to traffic that has a source
            IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be
            expressed in CIDR format. One or both of
            sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both
            fields are set, the rule applies to traffic that
            has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a
            source IP from a resource with a matching tag
            listed in the sourceTags field. The connection
            does not need to match both fields for the rule
            to apply. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
        source_service_accounts (MutableSequence[str]):
            If source service accounts are specified, the
            firewall rules apply only to traffic originating
            from an instance with a service account in this
            list. Source service accounts cannot be used to
            control traffic to an instance's external IP
            address because service accounts are associated
            with an instance, not an IP address.
            sourceRanges can be set at the same time as
            sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the
            firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP
            address within the sourceRanges OR a source IP
            that belongs to an instance with service account
            listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection
            does not need to match both fields for the
            firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot
            be used at the same time as sourceTags or
            targetTags.
        source_tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            If source tags are specified, the firewall
            rule applies only to traffic with source IPs
            that match the primary network interfaces of VM
            instances that have the tag and are in the same
            VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to
            control traffic to an instance's external IP
            address, it only applies to traffic between
            instances in the same virtual network. Because
            tags are associated with instances, not IP
            addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and
            sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set,
            the firewall applies to traffic that has a
            source IP address within sourceRanges OR a
            source IP from a resource with a matching tag
            listed in the sourceTags field. The connection
            does not need to match both fields for the
            firewall to apply.
        target_service_accounts (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances
            located in the network that may make network connections as
            specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used
            at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither
            targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the
            firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
            network.
        target_tags (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of tags that controls which instances
            the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are
            specified, then the firewall rule applies only
            to instances in the VPC network that have one of
            those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the
            firewall rule applies to all instances on the
            specified network.

        I_p_address (str):
            IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic.
            When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the
            forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target
            or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule,
            specifying an IPAddress is required under the following
            circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy
            and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress
            should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private
            Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an
            IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP
            address that references an existing static (reserved) IP
            address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an
            ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to
            specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: \*
            IP address number, as in ``100.1.2.3`` \* IPv6 address

        metadata_filters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.MetadataFilter]):
            Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict
            routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant
            clients. In their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients
            present node metadata. When there is a match, the relevant
            configuration is made available to those proxies. Otherwise,
            all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced
            by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those proxies. For
            each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria
            is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must
            match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If
            its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its
            filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided
            in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified,
            all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a
            match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed
            before those specified in the UrlMap that this
            ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to
            Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
            INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        name (str):
            Name of the resource; provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For
            Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward
            traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a
            1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and numbers
            and must start with a letter.

            Load Balancers, this field identifies the
            network that the load balanced IP should belong
            to for this forwarding rule. If the subnetwork
            is specified, the network of the subnetwork will
            be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is
            specified, the default network will be used. For
            Private Service Connect forwarding rules that
            forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must
            be provided.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_network``.
        network_tier (str):
            This signifies the networking tier used for

            regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are
            PREMIUM and STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule,
            the valid value is PREMIUM. If this field is not
            specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If
            IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal
            to the networkTier of the Address. Check the

            forwarding rules do not use this field. Once
            set, this field is not mutable.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_no_automate_dns_zone``.
        port_range (str):
            The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually
            exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified
            range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
            forwarding rule. The portRange field has the following
            limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule
            IPProtocol be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only
            to the following products: external passthrough Network Load
            Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
            Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers,
            external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. - Some
            products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See

        ports (MutableSequence[str]):
            The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually
            exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified
            range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
            forwarding rule. The ports field has the following
            limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule
            IPProtocol be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only
            to the following products: internal passthrough Network Load
            Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough
            Network Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding. -
            You can specify a list of up to five ports by number,
            separated by commas. The ports can be contiguous or
            discontiguous. For external forwarding rules, two or more
            forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol]
            pair if they share at least one port number. For internal
            forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
            forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol]
            pair if they share at least one port number. @pattern:

        psc_connection_id (int):
            [Output Only] The PSC connection id of the PSC forwarding
            rule.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_psc_connection_id``.
        psc_connection_status (str):
            Check the PscConnectionStatus enum for the
            list of possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_psc_connection_status``.
        region (str):
            [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional
            forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to
            global forwarding rules. You must specify this field as part
            of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in
            the request body.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_region``.
        self_link (str):
            [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_self_link``.
        service_directory_registrations (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistration]):
            Service Directory resources to register this
            forwarding rule with. Currently, only supports a
            single Service Directory resource.
        service_label (str):
            An optional prefix to the service name for this forwarding
            rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the
            fully qualified service name. The label must be 1-63
            characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
            label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
            expression ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the
            first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
            following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or
            digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
            This field is only used for internal load balancing.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_service_label``.
        service_name (str):
            [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for
            this forwarding rule. This field is only used for internal
            load balancing.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_service_name``.
        source_ip_ranges (MutableSequence[str]):
            If not empty, this forwarding rule will only forward the
            traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP
            addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a forwarding
            rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field
            can only be used with a regional forwarding rule whose
            scheme is EXTERNAL. Each source_ip_range entry should be
            either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range
            (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
        subnetwork (str):
            This field identifies the subnetwork that the
            load balanced IP should belong to for this
            forwarding rule, used with internal load
            balancers and external passthrough Network Load
            Balancers with IPv6. If the network specified is
            in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
            However, a subnetwork must be specified if the
            network is in custom subnet mode or when
            creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_subnetwork``.
        target (str):
            The URL of the target resource to receive the matched
            traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must be
            in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global
            forwarding rules, this target must be a global load
            balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type
            appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see
            the "Target" column in `Port
            specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`__.
            - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward
            traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported
            Google API bundle: - vpc-sc - APIs that support VPC Service
            Controls. - all-apis - All supported Google APIs. - For
            Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward
            traffic to managed services, the target must be a service
            attachment. The target is not mutable once set as a service
            attachment.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        nat_name (str):
            Name of the nat service to filter the Nat
            Mapping information. If it is omitted, all nats
            for this router will be returned. Name should
            conform to RFC1035.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_nat_name``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_page_token``.
        project (str):
            Project ID for this request.
        region (str):
            Name of the region for this request.
        return_partial_success (bool):
            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no
            resources, with an error code.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_return_partial_success``.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

        project (str):
            Project ID for this request.
        return_partial_success (bool):
            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no
            resources, with an error code.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        description (str):
            The short description conveying the intent of
            this routeRule. The description can have a
            maximum length of 1024 characters.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_description``.
        header_action (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.HttpHeaderAction):
            Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
            to take effect for the selected backendService. The
            headerAction value specified here is applied before the
            matching pathMatchers[].headerAction and after
            pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeAction.weightedBackendService.backendServiceWeightAction[].headerAction
            HeaderAction is not supported for load balancers that have
            their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported
            when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has
            validateForProxyless field set to true.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_header_action``.
        match_rules (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.HttpRouteRuleMatch]):
            The list of criteria for matching attributes
            of a request to this routeRule. This list has OR
            semantics: the request matches this routeRule
            when any of the matchRules are satisfied.
            However predicates within a given matchRule have
            AND semantics. All predicates within a matchRule
            must match for the request to match the rule.
        priority (int):
            For routeRules within a given pathMatcher,
            priority determines the order in which a load
            balancer interprets routeRules. RouteRules are
            evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest
            to highest number. The priority of a rule
            decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3,
            N+1). The first rule that matches the request is
            applied. You cannot configure two or more
            routeRules with the same priority. Priority for
            each rule must be set to a number from 0 to
            2147483647 inclusive. Priority numbers can have
            gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in
            the future without affecting the rest of the
            rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is
            a valid series of priority numbers to which you
            could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11,
            and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on
            existing rules.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_priority``.
        route_action (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.HttpRouteAction):
            In response to a matching matchRule, the load
            balancer performs advanced routing actions, such
            as URL rewrites and header transformations,
            before forwarding the request to the selected
            backend. If routeAction specifies any
            weightedBackendServices, service must not be
            set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction
            cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only
            one of urlRedirect, service or
            routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
            URL maps for classic Application Load Balancers
            only support the urlRewrite action within a
            route rule's routeAction.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_route_action``.
        service (str):
            The full or partial URL of the backend
            service resource to which traffic is directed if
            this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
            specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL
            rewrites, take effect before sending the request
            to the backend. However, if service is
            specified, routeAction cannot contain any
            weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if
            routeAction specifies any
            weightedBackendServices, service must not be
            specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
            routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_service``.
        url_redirect (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.HttpRedirectAction):
            When this rule is matched, the request is
            redirected to a URL specified by urlRedirect. If
            urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction
            must not be set. Not supported when the URL map
            is bound to a target gRPC proxy.

            AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1 - AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_2 For improved
            reliability, customers should configure a pair of
            attachments, one per availability domain. The selected
            availability domain will be provided to the Partner via the
            pairing key, so that the provisioned circuit will lie in the
            specified domain. If not specified, the value will default
            to AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY. Check the EdgeAvailabilityDomain
            enum for the list of possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_edge_availability_domain``.
        encryption (str):
            Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this VLAN
            attachment (interconnectAttachment). Can only be specified
            at attachment creation for PARTNER or DEDICATED attachments.
            Possible values are: - NONE - This is the default value,
            which means that the VLAN attachment carries unencrypted
            traffic. VMs are able to send traffic to, or receive traffic
            from, such a VLAN attachment. - IPSEC - The VLAN attachment
            carries only encrypted traffic that is encrypted by an IPsec
            device, such as an HA VPN gateway or third-party IPsec VPN.
            VMs cannot directly send traffic to, or receive traffic
            from, such a VLAN attachment. To use *HA VPN over Cloud
            Interconnect*, the VLAN attachment must be created with this
            option. Check the Encryption enum for the list of possible
            values.

            connectivity issues. [Deprecated] This field is not used.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_google_reference_id``.
        id (int):
            [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This
            identifier is defined by the server.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_id``.
        interconnect (str):
            URL of the underlying Interconnect object
            that this attachment's traffic will traverse
            through.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_interconnect``.
        ipsec_internal_addresses (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of URLs of addresses that have been
            reserved for the VLAN attachment. Used only for
            the VLAN attachment that has the encryption
            option as IPSEC. The addresses must be regional
            internal IP address ranges. When creating an HA
            VPN gateway over the VLAN attachment, if the
            attachment is configured to use a regional
            internal IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
            address is allocated from the IP address range
            specified here. For example, if the HA VPN
            gateway's interface 0 is paired to this VLAN
            attachment, then a regional internal IP address
            for the VPN gateway interface 0 will be
            allocated from the IP address specified for this
            VLAN attachment. If this field is not specified

            PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED, and PENDING_CUSTOMER are used for
            only PARTNER and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments.
            This state can take one of the following values: - ACTIVE:
            The attachment has been turned up and is ready to use. -
            UNPROVISIONED: The attachment is not ready to use yet,
            because turnup is not complete. - PENDING_PARTNER: A
            newly-created PARTNER attachment that has not yet been
            configured on the Partner side. - PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED:
            A PARTNER attachment is in the process of provisioning after
            a PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment was created that references
            it. - PENDING_CUSTOMER: A PARTNER or PARTNER_PROVIDER
            attachment that is waiting for a customer to activate it. -
            DEFUNCT: The attachment was deleted externally and is no
            longer functional. This could be because the associated
            Interconnect was removed, or because the other side of a
            Partner attachment was deleted. Check the State enum for the
            list of possible values.

        subnet_length (int):
            Length of the IPv4 subnet mask. Allowed
            values: - 29 (default) - 30 The default value is
            29, except for Cross-Cloud Interconnect
            connections that use an
            InterconnectRemoteLocation with a
            constraints.subnetLengthRange.min equal to 30.
            For example, connections that use an Azure
            remote location fall into this category. In
            these cases, the default value is 30, and
            requesting 29 returns an error. Where both 29
            and 30 are allowed, 29 is preferred, because it
            gives Google Cloud Support more debugging
            visibility.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the

            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        instance_group_manager (str):
            The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string
            that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long
            integer: must match regexp pattern:
            (?:`a-z <?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9]>`__?)|1-9{0,19}.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_page_token``.
        project (str):
            Project ID for this request.
        return_partial_success (bool):
            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no
            resources, with an error code.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.

            default value is false. For example, when

            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the
            ``nextPageToken`` returned by a previous list request to get
            the next page of results.

            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            the next page of results.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by

            RFC1035.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse

            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been

            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``

            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You

            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_filter``.
        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_order_by``.
        page_token (str):
            Specifies a page token to use. Set ``pageToken`` to the

            the next page of results.

            Opt-in for partial success behavior which
            provides partial results in case of failure. The
            default value is false. For example, when
            partial success behavior is enabled,
            aggregatedList for a single zone scope either
            returns all resources in the zone or no

            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):

            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.

            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or

            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be
            returned. If the number of available results is larger than
            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to

        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

    Attributes:
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that filters resources listed in the
            response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter
            expressions: expressions that support regular expressions
            and expressions that follow API improvement proposal
            AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
            mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
            expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the
            value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
            a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be
            either ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=`` or ``:``.
            For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances,
            you can exclude instances named ``example-instance`` by
            specifying ``name != example-instance``. The ``:*``
            comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
            defined. For example, to find all objects with ``owner``
            label use: ``labels.owner:*`` You can also filter nested
            fields. For example, you could specify
            ``scheduling.automaticRestart = false`` to include instances
            only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You
            can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
            resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
            each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
            ``(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")``
            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:
            ``(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)``
            If you want to use a regular expression, use the ``eq``
            (equal) or ``ne`` (not equal) operator against a single
            un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or
            against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
            ``fieldname eq unquoted literal``
            ``fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'``
            ``fieldname eq "double quoted literal"``
            ``(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`` The
            literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using
            Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
            entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do
            not end with name "instance", you would use
            ``name ne .*instance``. You cannot combine constraints on
            multiple fields using regular expressions.

        max_results (int):
            The maximum number of results per page that should be

            ``maxResults``, Compute Engine returns a ``nextPageToken``
            that can be used to get the next page of results in
            subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are ``0`` to
            ``500``, inclusive. (Default: ``500``)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_max_results``.
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
            are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource
            name. You can also sort results in descending order based on
            the creation timestamp using
            ``orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"``. This sorts results
            based on the ``creationTimestamp`` field in reverse
            chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
            resources like operations so that the newest operation is
            returned first. Currently, only sorting by ``name`` or
            ``creationTimestamp desc`` is supported.

    `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionOperations>`__ \*
    `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/zoneOperations>`__ You can
    use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For
    more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be
    global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the
    ``globalOperations`` resource. - For regional operations, use the
    ``regionOperations`` resource. - For zonal operations, use the
    ``zoneOperations`` resource. For more information, read Global,
    Regional, and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation
    resources have a limited retention period.

            backend endpoint in success rate based outlier
            detection. If the volume is lower than this
            setting, outlier detection via success rate
            statistics is not performed for that backend
            endpoint. Defaults to 100. Not supported when
            the backend service uses Serverless NEG.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_success_rate_request_volume``.
        success_rate_stdev_factor (int):
            This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for
            success rate outlier ejection. The ejection threshold is the
            difference between the mean success rate, and the product of
            this factor and the standard deviation of the mean success
            rate: mean - (stdev \* successRateStdevFactor). This factor
            is divided by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the
            desired factor is 1.9, the runtime value should be 1900.
            Defaults to 1900. Not supported when the backend service

class Policy(proto.Message):
    r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies
    access controls for Google Cloud resources. A ``Policy`` is a
    collection of ``bindings``. A ``binding`` binds one or more
    ``members``, or principals, to a single ``role``. Principals can be
    user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as
    G Suite). A ``role`` is a named list of permissions; each ``role``
    can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For
    some types of Google Cloud resources, a ``binding`` can also specify
    a ``condition``, which is a logical expression that allows access to
    a resource only if the expression evaluates to ``true``. A condition
    can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
    resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in
    their IAM policies, see the `IAM
    documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies>`__.
    **JSON example:**
    ``{ "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }``
    **YAML example:**
    ``bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3``

        audit_configs (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.AuditConfig]):
            Specifies cloud audit logging configuration
            for this policy.
        bindings (MutableSequence[google.cloud.compute_v1.types.Binding]):
            Associates a list of ``members``, or principals, with a
            ``role``. Optionally, may specify a ``condition`` that
            determines how and when the ``bindings`` are applied. Each
            of the ``bindings`` must contain at least one principal. The
            ``bindings`` in a ``Policy`` can refer to up to 1,500
            principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these
            limits. For example, if the ``bindings`` grant 50 different
            roles to ``user:alice@example.com``, and not to any other
            principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the
            ``bindings`` in the ``Policy``.
        etag (str):
            ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way
            to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from
            overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that
            systems make use of the ``etag`` in the read-modify-write
            cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
            conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in the response to
            ``getIamPolicy``, and systems are expected to put that etag
            in the request to ``setIamPolicy`` to ensure that their
            change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
            **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include
            the ``etag`` field whenever you call ``setIamPolicy``. If
            you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a
            version ``3`` policy with a version ``1`` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version ``3`` policy are lost.

            This is deprecated and has no effect. Do not

        version (int):
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are ``0``,
            ``1``, and ``3``. Requests that specify an invalid value are
            rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role
            bindings must specify version ``3``. This requirement
            applies to the following operations: \* Getting a policy
            that includes a conditional role binding \* Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy \* Changing a
            conditional role binding in a policy \* Removing any role
            binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that
            includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
            Conditions, you must include the ``etag`` field whenever you
            call ``setIamPolicy``. If you omit this field, then IAM
            allows you to overwrite a version ``3`` policy with a
            version ``1`` policy, and all of the conditions in the
            version ``3`` policy are lost. If a policy does not include
            any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any
            valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

        match (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.SecurityPolicyRuleMatcher):
            A match condition that incoming traffic is
            evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the
            corresponding 'action' is enforced.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_match``.
        network_match (google.cloud.compute_v1.types.SecurityPolicyRuleNetworkMatcher):
            A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated
            against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it
            matches, the corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match
            criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like
            'srcIpRanges') and potentially multiple user-defined match
            fields ('userDefinedFields'). Field values may be extracted
            directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g.
            'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields may not be present in every
            packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined field is only
            present if the base header is found in the packet and the
            entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify
            which values can match it, listing one or more ranges,
            prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for
            the field. A field value must be present in order to match a
            specified match field. If no match values are specified for
            a match field, then any field value is considered to match
            it, and it's not required to be present. For strings
            specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet
            to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the
            corresponding field values derived from the packet. Example:
            networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" -
            "198.51.100.0/24" userDefinedFields: - name:
            "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: - "1-0x1fff" The above match
            condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24
            or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named
            "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff

            encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied
            key, you must provide the same key if you use
            the snapshot later. For example, you must
            provide the encryption key when you create a
            disk from the encrypted snapshot in a future
            request. Customer-supplied encryption keys do
            not protect access to metadata of the snapshot.
            If you do not provide an encryption key when
            creating the snapshot, then the snapshot will be
            encrypted using an automatically generated key
            and you do not need to provide a key to use the

            Specifies how long to keep a connection open,
            after completing a response, while there is no
            matching traffic (in seconds). If an HTTP
            keep-alive is not specified, a default value

        name (str):
            Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        proxy_bind (bool):
            This field only applies when the forwarding rule that

            determines whether the load balancer attempts to
            negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify
            NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. - When quic-override
            is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is
            used. - When quic-override is set to ENABLE, the
            load balancer uses QUIC when possible. - When

            Provide this property when you create the
            resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_description``.
        forwarding_rules (MutableSequence[str]):
            [Output Only] A list of URLs to the ForwardingRule
            resources. ForwardingRules are created using
            compute.forwardingRules.insert and associated with a VPN
            gateway.
        id (int):
            [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This
            identifier is defined by the server.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_id``.
        kind (str):
            [Output Only] Type of resource. Always
            compute#targetVpnGateway for target VPN gateways.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_kind``.
        label_fingerprint (str):
            A fingerprint for the labels being applied to
            this TargetVpnGateway, which is essentially a
            hash of the labels set used for optimistic
            locking. The fingerprint is initially generated
            by Compute Engine and changes after every
            request to modify or update labels. You must
            always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in
            order to update or change labels, otherwise the
            request will fail with error 412
            conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint,
            make a get() request to retrieve a
            TargetVpnGateway.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_label_fingerprint``.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels for this resource. These can only be
            added or modified by the setLabels method. Each
            label key/value pair must comply with RFC1035.
            Label values may be empty.
        name (str):
            Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the
            resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63
            characters long and match the regular expression
            ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
            except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        network (str):
            URL of the network to which this VPN gateway
            is attached. Provided by the client when the VPN
            gateway is created.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_network``.
        region (str):
            [Output Only] URL of the region where the target VPN gateway
            resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP
            request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request
            body.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_region``.
        self_link (str):
            [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_self_link``.
        status (str):
            [Output Only] The status of the VPN gateway, which can be
            one of the following: CREATING, READY, FAILED, or DELETING.
            Check the Status enum for the list of possible values.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_status``.
        tunnels (MutableSequence[str]):
            [Output Only] A list of URLs to VpnTunnel resources.

            /static/content/{format} to prefix /content to the URL.
            Variables can also be re-ordered in a rewrite, so that
