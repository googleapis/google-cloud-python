            Output only. Indicates the error reason code.

            Output only. If the scan encounters SCAN_CONFIG_ISSUE error,
            this field has the error message encountered during scan
            configuration validation that is performed before each scan
            run.
        most_common_http_error_code (int):
            Output only. If the scan encounters TOO_MANY_HTTP_ERRORS,
            this field indicates the most common HTTP error code, if
            such is available. For example, if this code is 404, the
            scan has encountered too many NOT_FOUND responses.

        Values:
            CODE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Default value is never used.
            INTERNAL_ERROR (1):
                Indicates that the scan run failed due to an
                internal server error.
            SCAN_CONFIG_ISSUE (2):
                Indicates a scan configuration error, usually due to
                outdated ScanConfig settings, such as starting_urls or the
                DNS configuration.
            AUTHENTICATION_CONFIG_ISSUE (3):
                Indicates an authentication error, usually
                due to outdated ScanConfig authentication
                settings.
            TIMED_OUT_WHILE_SCANNING (4):
                Indicates a scan operation timeout, usually
                caused by a very large site.
            TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (5):
                Indicates that a scan encountered excessive
                redirects, either to authentication or some
                other page outside of the scan scope.
            TOO_MANY_HTTP_ERRORS (6):
                Indicates that a scan encountered numerous errors from the
                web site pages. When available, most_common_http_error_code
                field indicates the most common HTTP error code encountered
                during the scan.
