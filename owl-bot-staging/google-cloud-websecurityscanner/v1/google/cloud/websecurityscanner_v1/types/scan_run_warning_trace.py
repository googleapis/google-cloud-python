            INSUFFICIENT_CRAWL_RESULTS (1):
                Indicates that a scan discovered an
                unexpectedly low number of URLs. This is
                sometimes caused by complex navigation features
                or by using a single URL for numerous pages.
            TOO_MANY_CRAWL_RESULTS (2):
                Indicates that a scan discovered too many
                URLs to test, or excessive redundant URLs.
            TOO_MANY_FUZZ_TASKS (3):
                Indicates that too many tests have been
                generated for the scan. Customer should try
                reducing the number of starting URLs, increasing
                the QPS rate, or narrowing down the scope of the
                scan using the excluded patterns.
            BLOCKED_BY_IAP (4):
                Indicates that a scan is blocked by IAP.
            NO_STARTING_URL_FOUND_FOR_MANAGED_SCAN (5):
                Indicates that no seeds is found for a scan
