    ApiSpecs provide formal descriptions that consumers can use to
    use a version. ApiSpec resources are intended to be
    fully-resolved descriptions of an ApiVersion. When specs consist
    of multiple files, these should be bundled together (e.g., in a
    zip archive) and stored as a unit. Multiple specs can exist to
    provide representations in different API description formats.
    Synchronization of these representations would be provided by
    tooling and background services.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Resource name.
        filename (str):
            A possibly-hierarchical name used to refer to
            the spec from other specs.
        description (str):
            A detailed description.
        revision_id (str):
            Output only. Immutable. The revision ID of
            the spec. A new revision is committed whenever
            the spec contents are changed. The format is an
            8-character hexadecimal string.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Creation timestamp; when the
            spec resource was created.
        revision_create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Revision creation timestamp;
            when the represented revision was created.
        revision_update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Last update timestamp: when the
            represented revision was last modified.
        mime_type (str):
            A style (format) descriptor for this spec that is specified
            as a Media Type (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type).
            Possible values include ``application/vnd.apigee.proto``,
            ``application/vnd.apigee.openapi``, and
            ``application/vnd.apigee.graphql``, with possible suffixes
            representing compression types. These hypothetical names are
            defined in the vendor tree defined in RFC6838
            (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838) and are not final.
            Content types can specify compression. Currently only GZip
            compression is supported (indicated with "+gzip").
        size_bytes (int):
            Output only. The size of the spec file in

            Output only. A SHA-256 hash of the spec's
            contents. If the spec is gzipped, this is the
            hash of the uncompressed spec.
        source_uri (str):
            The original source URI of the spec (if one
            exists). This is an external location that can
            be used for reference purposes but which may not
            be authoritative since this external resource
            may change after the spec is retrieved.
        contents (bytes):
            Input only. The contents of the spec.
            Provided by API callers when specs are created
            or updated. To access the contents of a spec,
            use GetApiSpecContents.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels attach identifying metadata to resources. Identifying
            metadata can be used to filter list operations.

            Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
