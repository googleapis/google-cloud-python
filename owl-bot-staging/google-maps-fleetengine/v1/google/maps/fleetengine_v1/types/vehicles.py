        last_location (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleLocation):
            Last reported location of the vehicle.

            List of vehicle attributes. A vehicle can
            have at most 100 attributes, and each attribute
            must have a unique key.
        vehicle_type (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.Vehicle.VehicleType):
            Required. The type of this vehicle. Can be used to filter

            and route calculations.
        license_plate (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.LicensePlate):

        route (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TerminalLocation]):
            Deprecated: Use ``Vehicle.waypoints`` instead.
        current_route_segment (str):
            The polyline specifying the route the driver app intends to
            take to the next waypoint. This list is also returned in
            ``Trip.current_route_segment`` for all active trips assigned
            to the vehicle.

        current_route_segment_traffic (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TrafficPolylineData):
            Input only. Fleet Engine uses this

            Driver SDK.
        current_route_segment_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Time when ``current_route_segment`` was set. It
            can be stored by the client and passed in future
            ``GetVehicle`` requests to prevent returning routes that
            haven't changed.
        current_route_segment_end_point (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripWaypoint):
            The waypoint where ``current_route_segment`` ends. This can
            be supplied by drivers on ``UpdateVehicle`` calls either as
            a full trip waypoint, a waypoint ``LatLng``, or as the last
            ``LatLng`` of the ``current_route_segment``. Fleet Engine
            will then do its best to interpolate to an actual waypoint
            if it is not fully specified. This field is ignored in
            ``UpdateVehicle`` calls unless ``current_route_segment`` is
            also specified.
        remaining_distance_meters (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            The remaining driving distance for the
            ``current_route_segment``. This value is also returned in
            ``Trip.remaining_distance_meters`` for all active trips
            assigned to the vehicle. The value is unspecified if the
            ``current_route_segment`` field is empty.
        eta_to_first_waypoint (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The ETA to the first entry in the ``waypoints`` field. The
            value is unspecified if the ``waypoints`` field is empty or
            the ``Vehicle.current_route_segment`` field is empty.

            When updating a vehicle, ``remaining_time_seconds`` takes
            precedence over ``eta_to_first_waypoint`` in the same
            request.
        remaining_time_seconds (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            Input only. The remaining driving time for the
            ``current_route_segment``. The value is unspecified if the
            ``waypoints`` field is empty or the
            ``Vehicle.current_route_segment`` field is empty. This value
            should match ``eta_to_first_waypoint`` - ``current_time`` if
            all parties are using the same clock.

            When updating a vehicle, ``remaining_time_seconds`` takes
            precedence over ``eta_to_first_waypoint`` in the same
            request.
        waypoints (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripWaypoint]):
            The remaining waypoints assigned to this
            Vehicle.
        waypoints_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Last time the ``waypoints`` field was updated.
            Clients should cache this value and pass it in
            ``GetVehicleRequest`` to ensure the ``waypoints`` field is
            only returned if it is updated.
        back_to_back_enabled (bool):
            Indicates if the driver accepts back-to-back trips. If
            ``true``, ``SearchVehicles`` may include the vehicle even if
            it is currently assigned to a trip. The default value is
            ``false``.
        navigation_status (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.NavigationStatus):
            The vehicle's navigation status.
        device_settings (google.maps.fleetengine_v1.types.DeviceSettings):
            Input only. Information about settings in the
            mobile device being used by the driver.
