class Task(proto.Message):
    r"""A unit of scheduled work.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Optionally caller-specified in
            [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CreateTask].

            The task name.

            The task name must have the following format:
            ``projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID``

            -  ``PROJECT_ID`` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers
               ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For
               more information, see `Identifying
               projects <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects>`__
            -  ``LOCATION_ID`` is the canonical ID for the task's
               location. The list of available locations can be obtained
               by calling
               [ListLocations][google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations].
               For more information, see
               https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.
            -  ``QUEUE_ID`` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers
               ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100
               characters.
            -  ``TASK_ID`` can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers
               ([0-9]), hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum
               length is 500 characters.
        app_engine_http_request (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta2.types.AppEngineHttpRequest):
            App Engine HTTP request that is sent to the task's target.
            Can be set only if
            [app_engine_http_target][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Queue.app_engine_http_target]
            is set on the queue.

            An App Engine task is a task that has
            [AppEngineHttpRequest][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.AppEngineHttpRequest]
            set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload_type``.

            [LeaseTasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.LeaseTasks]
            to process the task. Can be set only if
            [pull_target][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Queue.pull_target]
            is set on the queue.

            A pull task is a task that has
            [PullMessage][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.PullMessage] set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload_type``.
        http_request (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta2.types.HttpRequest):
            HTTP request that is sent to the task's target.

            An HTTP task is a task that has
            [HttpRequest][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.HttpRequest] set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``payload_type``.
        schedule_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted.

            For App Engine queues, this is when the task will be
            attempted or retried.

            For pull queues, this is the time when the task is available
            to be leased; if a task is currently leased, this is the
            time when the current lease expires, that is, the time that
            the task was leased plus the
            [lease_duration][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.LeaseTasksRequest.lease_duration].

            ``schedule_time`` will be truncated to the nearest
            microsecond.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time that the task was created.

            ``create_time`` will be truncated to the nearest second.
        status (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta2.types.TaskStatus):
            Output only. The task status.
        view (google.cloud.tasks_v2beta2.types.Task.View):
            Output only. The view specifies which subset of the
            [Task][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task] has been returned.
    """

        [Task][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task] data.

        When a task is returned in a response, not all information is

        because of the sensitivity of data that it contains.

                contain sensitive data.
