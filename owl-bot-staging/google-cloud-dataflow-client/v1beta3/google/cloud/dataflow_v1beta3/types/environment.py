        disk_type (str):

class WorkerPool(proto.Message):

    instantiated by the Cloud Dataflow service in order to perform
    the computations required by a job.  Note that a workflow job
    may use multiple pools, in order to match the various
    computational requirements of the various stages of the job.

    Attributes:
        kind (str):
            The kind of the worker pool; currently only ``harness`` and
            ``shuffle`` are supported.
        num_workers (int):
            Number of Google Compute Engine workers in
            this pool needed to execute the job.  If zero or
            unspecified, the service will attempt to choose
            a reasonable default.
        packages (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.Package]):
            Packages to be installed on workers.
        default_package_set (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.DefaultPackageSet):
            The default package set to install.  This
            allows the service to select a default set of
            packages which are useful to worker harnesses
            written in a particular language.
        machine_type (str):
            Machine type (e.g. "n1-standard-1").  If
            empty or unspecified, the service will attempt
            to choose a reasonable default.
        teardown_policy (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.TeardownPolicy):
            Sets the policy for determining when to turndown worker
            pool. Allowed values are: ``TEARDOWN_ALWAYS``,
            ``TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS``, and ``TEARDOWN_NEVER``.
            ``TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`` means workers are always torn down
            regardless of whether the job succeeds.
            ``TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS`` means workers are torn down if the
            job succeeds. ``TEARDOWN_NEVER`` means the workers are never
            torn down.

            If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will
            continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources
            in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated
            by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the
            ``TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`` policy except for small, manually
            supervised test jobs.

            If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to
            choose a reasonable default.
        disk_size_gb (int):
            Size of root disk for VMs, in GB.  If zero or
            unspecified, the service will attempt to choose
            a reasonable default.
        disk_type (str):
            Type of root disk for VMs.  If empty or
            unspecified, the service will attempt to choose
            a reasonable default.
        disk_source_image (str):
            Fully qualified source image for disks.
        zone (str):
            Zone to run the worker pools in.  If empty or
            unspecified, the service will attempt to choose
            a reasonable default.
        taskrunner_settings (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.TaskRunnerSettings):
            Settings passed through to Google Compute
            Engine workers when using the standard Dataflow
            task runner.  Users should ignore this field.
        on_host_maintenance (str):
            The action to take on host maintenance, as
            defined by the Google Compute Engine API.
        data_disks (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.Disk]):
            Data disks that are used by a VM in this
            workflow.
        metadata (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Metadata to set on the Google Compute Engine
            VMs.
        autoscaling_settings (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.AutoscalingSettings):
            Settings for autoscaling of this WorkerPool.
        pool_args (google.protobuf.any_pb2.Any):
            Extra arguments for this worker pool.
        network (str):
            Network to which VMs will be assigned.  If
            empty or unspecified, the service will use the
            network "default".
        subnetwork (str):
            Subnetwork to which VMs will be assigned, if
            desired.  Expected to be of the form
            "regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNETWORK".
        worker_harness_container_image (str):
            Required. Docker container image that executes the Cloud
            Dataflow worker harness, residing in Google Container
            Registry.

            Deprecated for the Fn API path. Use
            sdk_harness_container_images instead.
        num_threads_per_worker (int):
            The number of threads per worker harness. If
            empty or unspecified, the service will choose a
            number of threads (according to the number of
            cores on the selected machine type for batch, or
            1 by convention for streaming).
        ip_configuration (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.WorkerIPAddressConfiguration):
            Configuration for VM IPs.
        sdk_harness_container_images (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.SdkHarnessContainerImage]):
            Set of SDK harness containers needed to
            execute this pipeline. This will only be set in
            the Fn API path. For non-cross-language
            pipelines this should have only one entry.
            Cross-language pipelines will have two or more
            entries.
