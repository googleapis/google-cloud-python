            The unique ID of this job.

            This field is set by the Cloud Dataflow service
            when the Job is created, and is immutable for
            the life of the job.
        project_id (str):
            The ID of the Cloud Platform project that the
            job belongs to.
        name (str):
            The user-specified Cloud Dataflow job name.

            Only one Job with a given name may exist in a project at any
            given time. If a caller attempts to create a Job with the
            same name as an already-existing Job, the attempt returns
            the existing Job.

            The name must match the regular expression

        type_ (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.JobType):
            The type of Cloud Dataflow job.
        environment (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.Environment):
            The environment for the job.
        steps (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.Step]):
            Exactly one of step or steps_location should be specified.

            The top-level steps that constitute the entire job. Only
            retrieved with JOB_VIEW_ALL.
        steps_location (str):
            The Cloud Storage location where the steps
            are stored.
        current_state (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.JobState):
            The current state of the job.

            Jobs are created in the ``JOB_STATE_STOPPED`` state unless
            otherwise specified.

            A job in the ``JOB_STATE_RUNNING`` state may asynchronously
            enter a terminal state. After a job has reached a terminal
            state, no further state updates may be made.

            This field may be mutated by the Cloud Dataflow service;
            callers cannot mutate it.
        current_state_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp associated with the current
            state.
        requested_state (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.JobState):
            The job's requested state.

            ``UpdateJob`` may be used to switch between the
            ``JOB_STATE_STOPPED`` and ``JOB_STATE_RUNNING`` states, by
            setting requested_state. ``UpdateJob`` may also be used to
            directly set a job's requested state to
            ``JOB_STATE_CANCELLED`` or ``JOB_STATE_DONE``, irrevocably
            terminating the job if it has not already reached a terminal
            state.
        execution_info (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.JobExecutionInfo):
            Deprecated.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp when the job was initially
            created. Immutable and set by the Cloud Dataflow
            service.
        replace_job_id (str):
            If this job is an update of an existing job, this field is
            the job ID of the job it replaced.

            When sending a ``CreateJobRequest``, you can update a job by
            specifying it here. The job named here is stopped, and its
            intermediate state is transferred to this job.
        transform_name_mapping (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The map of transform name prefixes of the job
            to be replaced to the corresponding name
            prefixes of the new job.
        client_request_id (str):
            The client's unique identifier of the job,
            re-used across retried attempts. If this field
            is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness.
            The request to create a job will fail if the
            service has knowledge of a previously submitted
            job with the same client's ID and job name. The
            caller may use this field to ensure idempotence
            of job creation across retried attempts to
            create a job. By default, the field is empty
            and, in that case, the service ignores it.
        replaced_by_job_id (str):
            If another job is an update of this job (and thus, this job
            is in ``JOB_STATE_UPDATED``), this field contains the ID of
            that job.
        temp_files (MutableSequence[str]):
            A set of files the system should be aware of
            that are used for temporary storage. These
            temporary files will be removed on job
            completion.
            No duplicates are allowed.
            No file patterns are supported.

            The supported files are:

            Google Cloud Storage:

               storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{object}
               bucket.storage.googleapis.com/{object}
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            User-defined labels for this job.

            The labels map can contain no more than 64 entries. Entries
            of the labels map are UTF8 strings that comply with the
            following restrictions:

            -  Keys must conform to regexp:
               [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}
            -  Values must conform to regexp:
               [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}
            -  Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be
               <= 128 bytes in size.
        location (str):
            The [regional endpoint]
            (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints)
            that contains this job.
        pipeline_description (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.PipelineDescription):
            Preliminary field: The format of this data may change at any
            time. A description of the user pipeline and stages through
            which it is executed. Created by Cloud Dataflow service.
            Only retrieved with JOB_VIEW_DESCRIPTION or JOB_VIEW_ALL.
        stage_states (MutableSequence[google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.ExecutionStageState]):
            This field may be mutated by the Cloud
            Dataflow service; callers cannot mutate it.
        job_metadata (google.cloud.dataflow_v1beta3.types.JobMetadata):
            This field is populated by the Dataflow
            service to support filtering jobs by the
            metadata values provided here. Populated for
            ListJobs and all GetJob views SUMMARY and
            higher.
        start_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The timestamp when the job was started (transitioned to
            JOB_STATE_PENDING). Flexible resource scheduling jobs are
            started with some delay after job creation, so start_time is
            unset before start and is updated when the job is started by
            the Cloud Dataflow service. For other jobs, start_time
            always equals to create_time and is immutable and set by the
            Cloud Dataflow service.
        created_from_snapshot_id (str):
            If this is specified, the job's initial state
            is populated from the given snapshot.
        satisfies_pzs (bool):
            Reserved for future use. This field is set
            only in responses from the server; it is ignored
            if it is set in any requests.

    A job consists of multiple steps, each of which performs some
    specific operation as part of the overall job. Data is typically
    passed from one step to another as part of the job.

    Here's an example of a sequence of steps which together implement a
    Map-Reduce job:

    -  Read a collection of data from some source, parsing the
       collection's elements.

    -  Validate the elements.

    -  Apply a user-defined function to map each element to some value
       and extract an element-specific key value.

    -  Group elements with the same key into a single element with that
       key, transforming a multiply-keyed collection into a
       uniquely-keyed collection.

    -  Write the elements out to some data sink.

    Note that the Cloud Dataflow service may be used to run many
    different types of jobs, not just Map-Reduce.
