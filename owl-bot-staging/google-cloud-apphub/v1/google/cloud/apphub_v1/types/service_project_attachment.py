    r"""ServiceProjectAttachment represents an attachment from a
    service project to a host project. Service projects contain the
    underlying cloud infrastructure resources, and expose these
    resources to the host project through a
    ServiceProjectAttachment. With the attachments, the host project
    can provide an aggregated view of resources across all service
    projects.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The resource name of a
            ServiceProjectAttachment. Format:
            "projects/{host-project-id}/locations/global/serviceProjectAttachments/{service-project-id}.".
        service_project (str):
            Required. Immutable. Service project name in
            the format: "projects/abc" or "projects/123". As
            input, project name with either project id or
            number are accepted. As output, this field will
            contain project number.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Create time.
        uid (str):
            Output only. A globally unique identifier (in UUID4 format)
            for the ``ServiceProjectAttachment``.
        state (google.cloud.apphub_v1.types.ServiceProjectAttachment.State):
            Output only. ServiceProjectAttachment state.
