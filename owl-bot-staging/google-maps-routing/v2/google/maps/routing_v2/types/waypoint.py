class Waypoint(proto.Message):
    r"""Encapsulates a waypoint. Waypoints mark both the beginning
    and end of a route, and include intermediate stops along the
    route.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        location (google.maps.routing_v2.types.Location):
            A point specified using geographic
            coordinates, including an optional heading.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``location_type``.
        place_id (str):
            The POI Place ID associated with the
            waypoint.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``location_type``.
        address (str):
            Human readable address or a plus code.
            See https://plus.codes for details.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``location_type``.
        via (bool):
            Marks this waypoint as a milestone rather a stopping point.
            For each non-via waypoint in the request, the response
            appends an entry to the
            [``legs``][google.maps.routing.v2.Route.legs] array to
            provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the trip.
            Set this value to true when you want the route to pass
            through this waypoint without stopping over. Via waypoints
            don't cause an entry to be added to the ``legs`` array, but
            they do route the journey through the waypoint. You can only
            set this value on waypoints that are intermediates. The
            request fails if you set this field on terminal waypoints.
            If ``ComputeRoutesRequest.optimize_waypoint_order`` is set
            to true then this field cannot be set to true; otherwise,
            the request fails.
        vehicle_stopover (bool):
            Indicates that the waypoint is meant for vehicles to stop
            at, where the intention is to either pickup or drop-off.
            When you set this value, the calculated route won't include
            non-\ ``via`` waypoints on roads that are unsuitable for
            pickup and drop-off. This option works only for ``DRIVE``
            and ``TWO_WHEELER`` travel modes, and when the
            ``location_type`` is
            [``Location``][google.maps.routing.v2.Location].
        side_of_road (bool):
            Indicates that the location of this waypoint is meant to
            have a preference for the vehicle to stop at a particular
            side of road. When you set this value, the route will pass
            through the location so that the vehicle can stop at the
            side of road that the location is biased towards from the
            center of the road. This option works only for ``DRIVE`` and
            ``TWO_WHEELER``
            [``RouteTravelMode``][google.maps.routing.v2.RouteTravelMode].
