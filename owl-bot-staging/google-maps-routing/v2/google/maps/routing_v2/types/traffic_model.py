class TrafficModel(proto.Enum):
    r"""Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic.
    This setting affects the value returned in the ``duration`` field in
    the response, which contains the predicted time in traffic based on
    historical averages.

    Values:
        TRAFFIC_MODEL_UNSPECIFIED (0):
            Unused. If specified, will default to ``BEST_GUESS``.
        BEST_GUESS (1):
            Indicates that the returned ``duration`` should be the best
            estimate of travel time given what is known about both
            historical traffic conditions and live traffic. Live traffic
            becomes more important the closer the ``departure_time`` is
            to now.
        PESSIMISTIC (2):
            Indicates that the returned duration should
            be longer than the actual travel time on most
            days, though occasional days with particularly
            bad traffic conditions may exceed this value.
        OPTIMISTIC (3):
            Indicates that the returned duration should
            be shorter than the actual travel time on most
            days, though occasional days with particularly
            good traffic conditions may be faster than this
            value.
