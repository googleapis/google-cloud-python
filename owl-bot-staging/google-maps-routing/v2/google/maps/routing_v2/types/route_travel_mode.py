    r"""A set of values used to specify the mode of travel. NOTE: ``WALK``,
    ``BICYCLE``, and ``TWO_WHEELER`` routes are in beta and might
    sometimes be missing clear sidewalks, pedestrian paths, or bicycling
    paths. You must display this warning to the user for all walking,
    bicycling, and two-wheel routes that you display in your app.

    Values:
        TRAVEL_MODE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
            No travel mode specified. Defaults to ``DRIVE``.
        DRIVE (1):
            Travel by passenger car.
        BICYCLE (2):
            Travel by bicycle.
        WALK (3):
            Travel by walking.
        TWO_WHEELER (4):
            Two-wheeled, motorized vehicle. For example, motorcycle.
            Note that this differs from the ``BICYCLE`` travel mode
            which covers human-powered mode.
        TRANSIT (7):
            Travel by public transit routes, where
            available.
