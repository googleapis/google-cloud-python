Python Client for Google Cloud Redis API
=================================================

Quick Start
-----------

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

1. `Select or create a Cloud Platform project.`_
2. `Enable billing for your project.`_
3. Enable the Google Cloud Redis API.
4. `Setup Authentication.`_

.. _Select or create a Cloud Platform project.: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
.. _Enable billing for your project.: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project
.. _Setup Authentication.: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library in a `virtualenv`_ using pip. `virtualenv`_ is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With `virtualenv`_, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

Mac/Linux
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    python3 -m venv <your-env>
    source <your-env>/bin/activate
    <your-env>/bin/pip install /path/to/library


Windows
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    python3 -m venv <your-env>
    <your-env>\Scripts\activate
    <your-env>\Scripts\pip.exe install \path\to\library


Logging
-------

This library uses the standard Python :code:`logging` functionality to log some RPC events that could be of interest for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Note the following:

#. Logs may contain sensitive information. Take care to **restrict access to the logs** if they are saved, whether it be on local storage or on Google Cloud Logging.
#. Google may refine the occurrence, level, and content of various log messages in this library without flagging such changes as breaking. **Do not depend on immutability of the logging events**.
#. By default, the logging events from this library are not handled. You must **explicitly configure log handling** using one of the mechanisms below.


Simple, environment-based configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable logging for this library without any changes in your code, set the :code:`GOOGLE_SDK_PYTHON_LOGGING_SCOPE` environment variable to a valid Google
logging scope. This configures handling of logging events (at level :code:`logging.DEBUG` or higher) from this library in a default manner, emitting the logged
messages in a structured format. It does not currently allow customizing the logging levels captured nor the handlers, formatters, etc. used for any logging
event.

A logging scope is a period-separated namespace that begins with :code:`google`, identifying the Python module or package to log.

- Valid logging scopes: :code:`google`, :code:`google.cloud.asset.v1`, :code:`google.api`, :code:`google.auth`, etc.
- Invalid logging scopes: :code:`foo`, :code:`123`, etc.

**NOTE**: If the logging scope is invalid, the library does not set up any logging handlers.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

- Enabling the default handler for all Google-based loggers

.. code-block:: console

    export GOOGLE_SDK_PYTHON_LOGGING_SCOPE=google

- Enabling the default handler for a specific Google module (for a client library called :code:`library_v1`):

.. code-block:: console

    export GOOGLE_SDK_PYTHON_LOGGING_SCOPE=google.cloud.library_v1


Advanced, code-based configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also configure a valid logging scope using Python's standard `logging` mechanism.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

- Configuring a handler for all Google-based loggers

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    from google.cloud.translate_v3 import translate

    base_logger = logging.getLogger("google")
    base_logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
    base_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

- Configuring a handler for a specific Google module (for a client library called :code:`library_v1`):

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    from google.cloud.translate_v3 import translate

    base_logger = logging.getLogger("google.cloud.library_v1")
    base_logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
    base_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)


Logging details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Regardless of which of the mechanisms above you use to configure logging for this library, by default logging events are not propagated up to the root
   logger from the `google`-level logger. If you need the events to be propagated to the root logger, you must explicitly set
   :code:`logging.getLogger("google").propagate = True` in your code.
#. You can mix the different logging configurations above for different Google modules. For example, you may want use a code-based logging configuration for
   one library, but decide you need to also set up environment-based logging configuration for another library.

   #. If you attempt to use both code-based and environment-based configuration for the same module, the environment-based configuration will be ineffectual
      if the code -based configuration gets applied first.

#. The Google-specific logging configurations (default handlers for environment-based configuration; not propagating logging events to the root logger) get
   executed the first time *any* client library is instantiated in your application, and only if the affected loggers have not been previously configured.
   (This is the reason for 2.i. above.)
