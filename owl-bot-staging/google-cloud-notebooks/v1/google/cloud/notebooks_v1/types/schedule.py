            A brief description of this environment.
        state (google.cloud.notebooks_v1.types.Schedule.State):

        cron_schedule (str):
            Cron-tab formatted schedule by which the job will execute.
            Format: minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week, e.g.

            Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight

            determined by the chosen tz. For UTC use the string "utc".
            If a time zone is not specified, the default will be in UTC

            Output only. Time the schedule was last
            updated.
        execution_template (google.cloud.notebooks_v1.types.ExecutionTemplate):
