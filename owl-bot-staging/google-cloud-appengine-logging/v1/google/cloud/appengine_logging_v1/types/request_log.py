        status (int):
            HTTP response status code. Example: 200, 404.

            Time this request spent in the pending
            request queue.
        instance_index (int):
            If the instance processing this request
            belongs to a manually scaled module, then this
            is the 0-based index of the instance. Otherwise,
            this value is -1.
        finished (bool):
            Whether this request is finished or active.
        first (bool):
            Whether this is the first ``RequestLog`` entry for this
            request. If an active request has several ``RequestLog``
            entries written to Stackdriver Logging, then this field will
            be set for one of them.
        instance_id (str):
            An identifier for the instance that handled
            the request.

            Stackdriver Trace identifier for this

        trace_sampled (bool):
            If true, the value in the 'trace_id' field was sampled for
            storage in a trace backend.
        source_reference (MutableSequence[google.cloud.appengine_logging_v1.types.SourceReference]):
            Source code for the application that handled
            this request. There can be more than one source
            reference per deployed application if source
            code is distributed among multiple repositories.
