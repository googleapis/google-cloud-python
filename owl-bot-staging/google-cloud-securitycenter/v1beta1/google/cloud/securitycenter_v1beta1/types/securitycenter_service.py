            Required. Name of the organization to groupBy. Its format is
            "organizations/[organization_id]".
        filter (str):
            Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets.
            The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions
            combined via logical operators ``AND`` and ``OR``.
            Parentheses are not supported, and ``OR`` has higher
            precedence than ``AND``.

            Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
            and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
            negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset
            resource. Examples include:

            -  name
            -  security_center_properties.resource_name
            -  resource_properties.a_property
            -  security_marks.marks.marka

            The supported operators are:

            -  ``=`` for all value types.
            -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
            -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

            The supported value types are:

            -  string literals in quotes.
            -  integer literals without quotes.
            -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.

            For example, ``resource_properties.size = 100`` is a valid
            filter string.
        group_by (str):
            Required. Expression that defines what assets fields to use
            for grouping. The string value should follow SQL syntax:
            comma separated list of fields. For example:
            "security_center_properties.resource_project,security_center_properties.project".

            The following fields are supported when compare_duration is
            not set:

            -  security_center_properties.resource_project
            -  security_center_properties.resource_type
            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent

            The following fields are supported when compare_duration is
            set:

            -  security_center_properties.resource_type
        compare_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            When compare_duration is set, the Asset's "state" property
            is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed,
            or remained present during the compare_duration period of
            time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between
            (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time.

            The state value is derived based on the presence of the
            asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes
            between the two times don't affect the result. For example,
            the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and
            re-created again.

            Possible "state" values when compare_duration is specified:

            -  "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present before
               compare_duration, but present at reference_time.
            -  "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the
               start of compare_duration, but not present at
               reference_time.
            -  "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both
               the start and the end of the time period defined by
               compare_duration and reference_time.

            This field is ignored if ``state`` is not a field in
            ``group_by``.
        read_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time used as a reference point when filtering
            assets. The filter is limited to assets existing
            at the supplied time and their values are those
            at that specific time. Absence of this field
            will default to the API's version of NOW.
        page_token (str):
            The value returned by the last ``GroupAssetsResponse``;
            indicates that this is a continuation of a prior
            ``GroupAssets`` call, and that the system should return the
            next page of data.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of results to return in a

            Expression that defines what fields and order to use for
            sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma
            separated list of fields. For example:
            "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting
            order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field,
            a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For
            example: "name desc,resource_properties.a_property".
            Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant.
            "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and " name desc ,
            resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent.
        read_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time used as a reference point when filtering
            assets. The filter is limited to assets existing
            at the supplied time and their values are those
            at that specific time. Absence of this field
            will default to the API's version of NOW.
        compare_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetResult's "state"
            attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was
            added, removed, or remained present during the
            compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time.
            This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and
            read_time.

            The state value is derived based on the presence of the
            asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes
            between the two times don't affect the result. For example,
            the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and
            re-created again.

            Possible "state" values when compare_duration is specified:

            -  "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present before
               compare_duration, but present at read_time.
            -  "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the
               start of compare_duration, but not present at read_time.
            -  "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both
               the start and the end of the time period defined by
               compare_duration and read_time.

            If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
            state is "UNUSED", which indicates that the asset is present
            at read_time.
        field_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            Optional. A field mask to specify the
            ListAssetsResult fields to be listed in the
            response. An empty field mask will list all
            fields.
        page_token (str):
            The value returned by the last ``ListAssetsResponse``;
            indicates that this is a continuation of a prior
            ``ListAssets`` call, and that the system should return the
            next page of data.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of results to return in a
            single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1,
            maximum is 1000.

            format is
            "organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id]". To
            list across all sources provide a source_id of ``-``. For
            example: organizations/{organization_id}/sources/-
        filter (str):
            Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings.
            The expression is a list of one or more restrictions
            combined via logical operators ``AND`` and ``OR``.
            Parentheses are not supported, and ``OR`` has higher
            precedence than ``AND``.

            Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
            and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
            negation. Examples include:

            -  name
            -  source_properties.a_property
            -  security_marks.marks.marka

            The supported operators are:

            -  ``=`` for all value types.
            -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
            -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

            The supported value types are:

            -  string literals in quotes.
            -  integer literals without quotes.
            -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.
