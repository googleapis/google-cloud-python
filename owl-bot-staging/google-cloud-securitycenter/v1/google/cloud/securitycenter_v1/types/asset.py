    The Asset is a Security Command Center resource that captures
    information about a single Google Cloud resource. All
    modifications to an Asset are only within the context of
    Security Command Center and don't affect the referenced Google
    Cloud resource.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The relative resource name of this asset. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
            Example:
            "organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}".
        security_center_properties (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Asset.SecurityCenterProperties):
            Security Command Center managed properties.
            These properties are managed by Security Command
            Center and cannot be modified by the user.
        resource_properties (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Resource managed properties. These properties
            are managed and defined by the Google Cloud
            resource and cannot be modified by the user.
        security_marks (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.SecurityMarks):
            User specified security marks. These marks
            are entirely managed by the user and come from
            the SecurityMarks resource that belongs to the
            asset.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time at which the asset was created in
            Security Command Center.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time at which the asset was last updated
            or added in Cloud SCC.
        iam_policy (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.Asset.IamPolicy):
            Cloud IAM Policy information associated with
            the Google Cloud resource described by the
            Security Command Center asset. This information
            is managed and defined by the Google Cloud
            resource and cannot be modified by the user.
        canonical_name (str):
            The canonical name of the resource. It's either
            "organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}",
            "folders/{folder_id}/assets/{asset_id}" or
            "projects/{project_number}/assets/{asset_id}", depending on
            the closest CRM ancestor of the resource.
