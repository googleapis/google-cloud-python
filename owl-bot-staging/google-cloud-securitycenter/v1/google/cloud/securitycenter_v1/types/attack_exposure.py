            A number between 0 (inclusive) and infinity
            that represents how important this finding is to
            remediate. The higher the score, the more
            important it is to remediate.
        latest_calculation_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The most recent time the attack exposure was
            updated on this finding.
        attack_exposure_result (str):
            The resource name of the attack path simulation result that
            contains the details regarding this attack exposure score.
            Example:
            ``organizations/123/simulations/456/attackExposureResults/789``
        state (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.AttackExposure.State):
            What state this AttackExposure is in. This
            captures whether or not an attack exposure has
            been calculated or not.
        exposed_high_value_resources_count (int):
            The number of high value resources that are
            exposed as a result of this finding.
        exposed_medium_value_resources_count (int):
            The number of medium value resources that are
            exposed as a result of this finding.
        exposed_low_value_resources_count (int):
            The number of high value resources that are
            exposed as a result of this finding.
