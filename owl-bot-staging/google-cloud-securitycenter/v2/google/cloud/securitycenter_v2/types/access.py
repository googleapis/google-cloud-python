class Access(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents an access event.

    Attributes:
        principal_email (str):
            Associated email, such as "foo@google.com".

            The email address of the authenticated user or a service
            account acting on behalf of a third party principal making
            the request. For third party identity callers, the
            ``principal_subject`` field is populated instead of this
            field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is
            sometimes redacted. For more information, see `Caller
            identities in audit
            logs <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id>`__.
        caller_ip (str):
            Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
        caller_ip_geo (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.Geolocation):
            The caller IP's geolocation, which identifies
            where the call came from.
        user_agent_family (str):
            Type of user agent associated with the
            finding. For example, an operating system shell
            or an embedded or standalone application.
        user_agent (str):
            The caller's user agent string associated
            with the finding.
        service_name (str):
            This is the API service that the service
            account made a call to, e.g.
            "iam.googleapis.com".
        method_name (str):
            The method that the service account called,
            e.g. "SetIamPolicy".
        principal_subject (str):
            A string that represents the principal_subject that is
            associated with the identity. Unlike ``principal_email``,
            ``principal_subject`` supports principals that aren't
            associated with email addresses, such as third party
            principals. For most identities, the format is
            ``principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool name}/subject/{subject}``.
            Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD, FREEFORM, and
            GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD, still use the legacy format
            ``serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]``.
        service_account_key_name (str):
            The name of the service account key that was used to create
            or exchange credentials when authenticating the service
            account that made the request. This is a scheme-less URI
            full resource name. For example:

            "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}".
        service_account_delegation_info (MutableSequence[google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.ServiceAccountDelegationInfo]):
            The identity delegation history of an authenticated service
            account that made the request. The
            ``serviceAccountDelegationInfo[]`` object contains
            information about the real authorities that try to access
            Google Cloud resources by delegating on a service account.
            When multiple authorities are present, they are guaranteed
            to be sorted based on the original ordering of the identity
            delegation events.
        user_name (str):
            A string that represents a username. The
            username provided depends on the type of the
            finding and is likely not an IAM principal. For
            example, this can be a system username if the
            finding is related to a virtual machine, or it
            can be an application login username.
