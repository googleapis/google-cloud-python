class Finding(proto.Message):
    r"""Security Command Center finding.

    A finding is a record of assessment data like security, risk,
    health, or privacy, that is ingested into Security Command
    Center for presentation, notification, analysis, policy testing,
    and enforcement. For example, a cross-site scripting (XSS)
    vulnerability in an App Engine application is a finding.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The `relative resource
            name <https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name>`__
            of the finding. The following list shows some examples:

            -

            ``organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}``

            following list shows some examples:

            -

            ``organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}``
            +
            ``organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/locations/{location_id}/findings/{finding_id}``

            The prefix is the closest CRM ancestor of the resource
            associated with the finding.
        parent (str):
            The relative resource name of the source and location the
            finding belongs to. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
            This field is immutable after creation time. The following
            list shows some examples:

            -  ``organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}``
            -  ``folders/{folders_id}/sources/{source_id}``
            -  ``projects/{projects_id}/sources/{source_id}``
            -

            ``organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/locations/{location_id}``

            -  ``folders/{folders_id}/sources/{source_id}/locations/{location_id}``
            -  ``projects/{projects_id}/sources/{source_id}/locations/{location_id}``
        resource_name (str):
            Immutable. For findings on Google Cloud resources, the full
            resource name of the Google Cloud resource this finding is
            for. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name
            When the finding is for a non-Google Cloud resource, the
            resourceName can be a customer or partner defined string.

            from a given source. Example: "XSS_FLASH_INJECTION".
        external_uri (str):
            The URI that, if available, points to a web
            page outside of Security Command Center where
            additional information about the finding can be
            found. This field is guaranteed to be either
            empty or a well formed URL.
        source_properties (MutableMapping[str, google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Value]):
            Source specific properties. These properties are managed by
            the source that writes the finding. The key names in the
            source_properties map must be between 1 and 255 characters,
            and must start with a letter and contain alphanumeric
            characters or underscores only.
        security_marks (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.SecurityMarks):
            Output only. User specified security marks.
            These marks are entirely managed by the user and
            come from the SecurityMarks resource that
            belongs to the finding.
        event_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The time the finding was first detected. If
            an existing finding is updated, then this is the
            time the update occurred. For example, if the
            finding represents an open firewall, this
            property captures the time the detector believes
            the firewall became open. The accuracy is
            determined by the detector. If the finding is
            later resolved, then this time reflects when the
            finding was resolved. This must not be set to a
            value greater than the current timestamp.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the finding
            was created in Security Command Center.
        severity (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.Finding.Severity):
            The severity of the finding. This field is
            managed by the source that writes the finding.
        mute (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.Finding.Mute):
            Indicates the mute state of a finding (either
            muted, unmuted or undefined). Unlike other
            attributes of a finding, a finding provider
            shouldn't set the value of mute.
        mute_info (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.Finding.MuteInfo):
            Output only. The mute information regarding
            this finding.
        finding_class (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.Finding.FindingClass):
            The class of the finding.
        indicator (google.cloud.securitycenter_v2.types.Indicator):
            Represents what's commonly known as an *indicator of
            compromise* (IoC) in computer forensics. This is an artifact
            observed on a network or in an operating system that, with
            high confidence, indicates a computer intrusion. For more
            information, see `Indicator of
            compromise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise>`__.

            CRITICAL (1):
                Vulnerability:

                A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable
                by an external actor, exploitable, and results
                in the direct ability to execute arbitrary code,
                exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional
                access and privileges to cloud resources and
                workloads. Examples include publicly accessible
                unprotected user data and public SSH access with
                weak or no passwords.

                Threat:

                Indicates a threat that is able to access,
                modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized
                code within existing resources.
            HIGH (2):
                Vulnerability:

                A high risk vulnerability can be easily
                discovered and exploited in combination with
                other vulnerabilities in order to gain direct
                access and the ability to execute arbitrary
                code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
                additional access and privileges to cloud
                resources and workloads. An example is a
                database with weak or no passwords that is only
                accessible internally. This database could
                easily be compromised by an actor that had
                access to the internal network.

                Threat:

                Indicates a threat that is able to create new
                computational resources in an environment but
                not able to access data or execute code in
                existing resources.
            MEDIUM (3):
                Vulnerability:

                A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
                actor to gain access to resources or privileges
                that enable them to eventually (through multiple
                steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the
                ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate
                data. An example is a service account with
                access to more projects than it should have. If
                an actor gains access to the service account,
                they could potentially use that access to
                manipulate a project the service account was not
                intended to.

                Threat:

                Indicates a threat that is able to cause
                operational impact but may not access data or
                execute unauthorized code.
            LOW (4):
                Vulnerability:

                A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
                organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities
                or active threats in their deployment, or
                prevents the root cause investigation of
