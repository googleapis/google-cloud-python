class Database(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents database access information, such as queries. A database
    may be a sub-resource of an instance (as in the case of Cloud SQL
    instances or Cloud Spanner instances), or the database instance
    itself. Some database resources might not have the `full resource
    name <https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names>`__ populated
    because these resource types, such as Cloud SQL databases, are not
    yet supported by Cloud Asset Inventory. In these cases only the
    display name is provided.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Some database resources may not have the `full resource
            name <https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names>`__
            populated because these resource types are not yet supported
            by Cloud Asset Inventory (e.g. Cloud SQL databases). In
            these cases only the display name will be provided. The
            `full resource
            name <https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names>`__ of
            the database that the user connected to, if it is supported
            by Cloud Asset Inventory.
        display_name (str):
            The human-readable name of the database that
            the user connected to.
        user_name (str):
            The username used to connect to the database.
            The username might not be an IAM principal and
            does not have a set format.
        query (str):
            The SQL statement that is associated with the
            database access.
        grantees (MutableSequence[str]):
            The target usernames, roles, or groups of an
            SQL privilege grant, which is not an IAM policy
            change.
        version (str):
            The version of the database, for example, POSTGRES_14. See
            `the complete
            list <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/rest/v1/SqlDatabaseVersion>`__.
