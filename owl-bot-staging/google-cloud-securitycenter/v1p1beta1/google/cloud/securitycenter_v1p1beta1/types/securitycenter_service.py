        filter (str):
            Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets.
            The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions
            combined via logical operators ``AND`` and ``OR``.
            Parentheses are supported, and ``OR`` has higher precedence
            than ``AND``.

            Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
            and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
            negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset
            resource. Examples include:

            -  name
            -  security_center_properties.resource_name
            -  resource_properties.a_property
            -  security_marks.marks.marka

            The supported operators are:

            -  ``=`` for all value types.
            -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
            -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

            The supported value types are:

            -  string literals in quotes.
            -  integer literals without quotes.
            -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.

            The following field and operator combinations are supported:

            -  name: ``=``

            -  update_time: ``=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``

               Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
               RFC3339 string. Examples:
               ``update_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"``
               ``update_time = 1560208038000``

            -  create_time: ``=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``

               Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
               RFC3339 string. Examples:
               ``create_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"``
               ``create_time = 1560208038000``

            -  iam_policy.policy_blob: ``=``, ``:``

            -  resource_properties: ``=``, ``:``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``,
               ``<=``

            -  security_marks.marks: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_name: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_name_display_name:
               ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_type: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name:
               ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name:
               ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_owners: ``=``, ``:``

            For example, ``resource_properties.size = 100`` is a valid
            filter string.

            Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a
            property existing: ``resource_properties.my_property : ""``

            Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter
            based on a property not existing:
            ``-resource_properties.my_property : ""``
        group_by (str):
            Required. Expression that defines what assets fields to use
            for grouping. The string value should follow SQL syntax:
            comma separated list of fields. For example:
            "security_center_properties.resource_project,security_center_properties.project".

            The following fields are supported when compare_duration is
            not set:

            -  security_center_properties.resource_project
            -  security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name
            -  security_center_properties.resource_type
            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent
            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name

            The following fields are supported when compare_duration is
            set:

            -  security_center_properties.resource_type
            -  security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name
            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name
        compare_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult's
            "state_change" property is updated to indicate whether the
            asset was added, removed, or remained present during the
            compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time.
            This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and
            read_time.

            The state change value is derived based on the presence of
            the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state
            changes between the two times don't affect the result. For
            example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed
            and re-created again.

            Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is
            specified:

            -  "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present at the
               start of compare_duration, but present at reference_time.
            -  "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the
               start of compare_duration, but not present at
               reference_time.
            -  "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both
               the start and the end of the time period defined by
               compare_duration and reference_time.

            If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
            state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set
            for all assets present at read_time.

            If this field is set then ``state_change`` must be a
            specified field in ``group_by``.
        read_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time used as a reference point when filtering
            assets. The filter is limited to assets existing
            at the supplied time and their values are those
            at that specific time. Absence of this field
            will default to the API's version of NOW.
        page_token (str):
            The value returned by the last ``GroupAssetsResponse``;
            indicates that this is a continuation of a prior
            ``GroupAssets`` call, and that the system should return the
            next page of data.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of results to return in a
            single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1,
            maximum is 1000.

            -  severity

            The following fields are supported when compare_duration is
            set:

            -  state_change
        read_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time used as a reference point when filtering
            findings. The filter is limited to findings
            existing at the supplied time and their values
            are those at that specific time. Absence of this
            field will default to the API's version of NOW.
        compare_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult's
            "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the
            finding had its state changed, the finding's state remained
            unchanged, or if the finding was added during the
            compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time.
            This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and
            read_time.

            The state_change value is derived based on the presence and
            state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate
            state changes between the two times don't affect the result.
            For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is
            made inactive and then active again.

            Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is
            specified:

            -  "CHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and
               matched the given filter at the start of
               compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.
            -  "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and
               matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration
               and did not change state at read_time.
            -  "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the
               given filter or was not present at the start of
               compare_duration, but was present at read_time.
            -  "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
               matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but
               did not match the filter at read_time.

            If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
            state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set
            for all findings present at read_time.

            If this field is set then ``state_change`` must be a
            specified field in ``group_by``.
        page_token (str):
            The value returned by the last ``GroupFindingsResponse``;
            indicates that this is a continuation of a prior
            ``GroupFindings`` call, and that the system should return
            the next page of data.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of results to return in a
            single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1,
            maximum is 1000.

            Its format is "organizations/[organization_id],
            folders/[folder_id], or projects/[project_id]".
        filter (str):
            Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets.
            The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions
            combined via logical operators ``AND`` and ``OR``.
            Parentheses are supported, and ``OR`` has higher precedence
            than ``AND``.

            Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
            and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
            negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset
            resource. Examples include:

            -  name
            -  security_center_properties.resource_name
            -  resource_properties.a_property
            -  security_marks.marks.marka

            The supported operators are:

            -  ``=`` for all value types.
            -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
            -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

            The supported value types are:

            -  string literals in quotes.
            -  integer literals without quotes.
            -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.

            The following are the allowed field and operator
            combinations:

            -  name: ``=``

            -  update_time: ``=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``

               Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
               RFC3339 string. Examples:
               ``update_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"``
               ``update_time = 1560208038000``

            -  create_time: ``=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``

               Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
               RFC3339 string. Examples:
               ``create_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"``
               ``create_time = 1560208038000``

            -  iam_policy.policy_blob: ``=``, ``:``

            -  resource_properties: ``=``, ``:``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``,
               ``<=``

            -  security_marks.marks: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_name: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_display_name: ``=``,
               ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_type: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name:
               ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_project: ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name:
               ``=``, ``:``

            -  security_center_properties.resource_owners: ``=``, ``:``

            For example, ``resource_properties.size = 100`` is a valid
            filter string.

            Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a
            property existing: ``resource_properties.my_property : ""``

            Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter
            based on a property not existing:
            ``-resource_properties.my_property : ""``
        order_by (str):
            Expression that defines what fields and order to use for
            sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma
            separated list of fields. For example:
            "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting
            order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field,
            a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For
            example: "name desc,resource_properties.a_property".
            Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant.
            "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and " name desc ,
            resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent.

            The following fields are supported: name update_time
            resource_properties security_marks.marks
            security_center_properties.resource_name
            security_center_properties.resource_display_name
            security_center_properties.resource_parent
            security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name
            security_center_properties.resource_project
            security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name
            security_center_properties.resource_type
        read_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time used as a reference point when filtering
            assets. The filter is limited to assets existing
            at the supplied time and their values are those
            at that specific time. Absence of this field
            will default to the API's version of NOW.
        compare_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetsResult's
            "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the
            asset was added, removed, or remained present during the
            compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time.
            This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and
            read_time.

            The state_change value is derived based on the presence of
            the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state
            changes between the two times don't affect the result. For
            example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed
            and re-created again.

            Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is
            specified:

            -  "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present at the
               start of compare_duration, but present at read_time.
            -  "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the
               start of compare_duration, but not present at read_time.
            -  "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both
               the start and the end of the time period defined by
               compare_duration and read_time.

            If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
            state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set
            for all assets present at read_time.
        field_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult
            fields to be listed in the response.
            An empty field mask will list all fields.
        page_token (str):
            The value returned by the last ``ListAssetsResponse``;
            indicates that this is a continuation of a prior

class ListFindingsRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""Request message for listing findings.

    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. Name of the source the findings belong to. Its
            format is
            "organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id],
            folders/[folder_id]/sources/[source_id], or
            projects/[project_id]/sources/[source_id]". To list across
            all sources provide a source_id of ``-``. For example:
            organizations/{organization_id}/sources/-,
            folders/{folder_id}/sources/- or
            projects/{projects_id}/sources/-
        filter (str):
            Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings.
            The expression is a list of one or more restrictions
            combined via logical operators ``AND`` and ``OR``.
            Parentheses are supported, and ``OR`` has higher precedence
            than ``AND``.

            Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
            and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
            negation. Examples include:

            -  name
            -  source_properties.a_property
            -  security_marks.marks.marka

            The supported operators are:

            -  ``=`` for all value types.
            -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
            -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

            The supported value types are:

            -  string literals in quotes.
            -  integer literals without quotes.
            -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.

            The following field and operator combinations are supported:

            -  name: ``=``

            -  parent: ``=``, ``:``

            -  resource_name: ``=``, ``:``

            -  state: ``=``, ``:``

            -  category: ``=``, ``:``

            -  external_uri: ``=``, ``:``

            -  event_time: ``=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``

            -  severity: ``=``, ``:``

               Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
               RFC3339 string. Examples:
               ``event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"``
               ``event_time = 1560208038000``

            security_marks.marks: ``=``, ``:`` source_properties: ``=``,
            ``:``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``

            For example, ``source_properties.size = 100`` is a valid
            filter string.

            Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a
            property existing: ``source_properties.my_property : ""``

            Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter
            based on a property not existing:
            ``-source_properties.my_property : ""``
        order_by (str):
            Expression that defines what fields and order to use for
            sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma
            separated list of fields. For example:
            "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting
            order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field,
            a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For
            example: "name desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant
            space characters in the syntax are insignificant. "name
            desc,source_properties.a_property" and " name desc ,
            source_properties.a_property " are equivalent.

            The following fields are supported: name parent state
            category resource_name event_time source_properties
            security_marks.marks
        read_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time used as a reference point when filtering
            findings. The filter is limited to findings
            existing at the supplied time and their values
            are those at that specific time. Absence of this
            field will default to the API's version of NOW.
        compare_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's
            "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the
            finding had its state changed, the finding's state remained
            unchanged, or if the finding was added in any state during
            the compare_duration period of time that precedes the
            read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
            compare_duration) and read_time.

            The state_change value is derived based on the presence and
            state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate
            state changes between the two times don't affect the result.
            For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is
            made inactive and then active again.

            Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is
            specified:

            -  "CHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and
               matched the given filter at the start of
               compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.
            -  "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and
               matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration
               and did not change state at read_time.
            -  "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the
               given filter or was not present at the start of
               compare_duration, but was present at read_time.
            -  "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
               matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but
               did not match the filter at read_time.

            If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
            state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set
            for all findings present at read_time.
        field_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            A field mask to specify the Finding fields to
            be listed in the response. An empty field mask
            will list all fields.
        page_token (str):
            The value returned by the last ``ListFindingsResponse``;
            indicates that this is a continuation of a prior
            ``ListFindings`` call, and that the system should return the
            next page of data.
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of results to return in a
            single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1,
            maximum is 1000.
