            FINDING.

                Expression that defines the filter to apply across
                create/update events of assets or findings as specified by
                the event type. The expression is a list of zero or more
                restrictions combined via logical operators ``AND`` and
                ``OR``. Parentheses are supported, and ``OR`` has higher
                precedence than ``AND``.

                Restrictions have the form ``<field> <operator> <value>``
                and may have a ``-`` character in front of them to indicate
                negation. The fields map to those defined in the
                corresponding resource.

                The supported operators are:

                -  ``=`` for all value types.
                -  ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=`` for integer values.
                -  ``:``, meaning substring matching, for strings.

                The supported value types are:

                -  string literals in quotes.
                -  integer literals without quotes.
                -  boolean literals ``true`` and ``false`` without quotes.
