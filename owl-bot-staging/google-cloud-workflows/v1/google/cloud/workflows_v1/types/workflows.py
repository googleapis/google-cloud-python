class Workflow(proto.Message):
    r"""Workflow program to be executed by Workflows.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The resource name of the workflow.
            Format:
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workflows/{workflow}
        description (str):
            Description of the workflow provided by the
            user. Must be at most 1000 unicode characters
            long.
        state (google.cloud.workflows_v1.types.Workflow.State):
            Output only. State of the workflow
            deployment.
        revision_id (str):
            Output only. The revision of the workflow. A new revision of
            a workflow is created as a result of updating the following
            properties of a workflow:

            -  [Service
               account][google.cloud.workflows.v1.Workflow.service_account]
            -  [Workflow code to be
               executed][google.cloud.workflows.v1.Workflow.source_contents]

            The format is "000001-a4d", where the first six characters
            define the zero-padded revision ordinal number. They are
            followed by a hyphen and three hexadecimal random
            characters.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp for when the
            workflow was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp for when the
            workflow was last updated.
        revision_create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp for the latest
            revision of the workflow's creation.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels associated with this workflow.
            Labels can contain at most 64 entries. Keys and
            values can be no longer than 63 characters and
            can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
            characters, underscores, and dashes. Label keys
            must start with a letter. International
            characters are allowed.
        service_account (str):
            The service account associated with the latest workflow
            version. This service account represents the identity of the
            workflow and determines what permissions the workflow has.
            Format: projects/{project}/serviceAccounts/{account} or
            {account}

            Using ``-`` as a wildcard for the ``{project}`` or not
            providing one at all will infer the project from the
            account. The ``{account}`` value can be the ``email``
            address or the ``unique_id`` of the service account.

            If not provided, workflow will use the project's default
            service account. Modifying this field for an existing
            workflow results in a new workflow revision.
        source_contents (str):
            Workflow code to be executed. The size limit
            is 128KB.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source_code``.
        crypto_key_name (str):
            Optional. The resource name of a KMS crypto key used to
            encrypt or decrypt the data associated with the workflow.

            Format:
            projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRing}/cryptoKeys/{cryptoKey}

            Using ``-`` as a wildcard for the ``{project}`` or not
            providing one at all will infer the project from the
            account.

            If not provided, data associated with the workflow will not
            be CMEK-encrypted.
        state_error (google.cloud.workflows_v1.types.Workflow.StateError):
            Output only. Error regarding the state of the
            workflow. For example, this field will have
            error details if the execution data is
            unavailable due to revoked KMS key permissions.
        call_log_level (google.cloud.workflows_v1.types.Workflow.CallLogLevel):
            Optional. Describes the level of platform
            logging to apply to calls and call responses
            during executions of this workflow. If both the
            workflow and the execution specify a logging
            level, the execution level takes precedence.
        user_env_vars (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. User-defined environment variables
            associated with this workflow revision. This map
            has a maximum length of 20. Each string can take
            up to 40KiB. Keys cannot be empty strings and
            cannot start with “GOOGLE” or “WORKFLOWS".
