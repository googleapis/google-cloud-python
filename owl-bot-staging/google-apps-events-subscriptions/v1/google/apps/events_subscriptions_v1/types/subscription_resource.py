class Subscription(proto.Message):
    r"""A subscription to receive events about a Google Workspace resource.
    To learn more about subscriptions, see the `Google Workspace Events
    API overview <https://developers.google.com/workspace/events>`__.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Non-empty default. The timestamp in UTC when
            the subscription expires. Always displayed on
            output, regardless of what was used on input.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``expiration``.
        ttl (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Input only. The time-to-live (TTL) or duration for the
            subscription. If unspecified or set to ``0``, uses the
            maximum possible duration.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``expiration``.
        name (str):
            Optional. Immutable. Identifier. Resource name of the
            subscription.

            Format: ``subscriptions/{subscription}``
        uid (str):
            Output only. System-assigned unique
            identifier for the subscription.
        target_resource (str):
            Required. Immutable. The Google Workspace resource that's
            monitored for events, formatted as the `full resource
            name <https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names>`__. To
            learn about target resources and the events that they
            support, see `Supported Google Workspace
            events <https://developers.google.com/workspace/events#supported-events>`__.

            A user can only authorize your app to create one
            subscription for a given target resource. If your app tries
            to create another subscription with the same user
            credentials, the request returns an ``ALREADY_EXISTS``
            error.
        event_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            Required. Immutable. Unordered list. Input for creating a
            subscription. Otherwise, output only. One or more types of
            events to receive about the target resource. Formatted
            according to the CloudEvents specification.

            The supported event types depend on the target resource of
            your subscription. For details, see `Supported Google
            Workspace
            events <https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides#supported-events>`__.

            By default, you also receive events about the `lifecycle of
            your
            subscription <https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/events-lifecycle>`__.
            You don't need to specify lifecycle events for this field.

            If you specify an event type that doesn't exist for the
            target resource, the request returns an HTTP
            ``400 Bad Request`` status code.
        payload_options (google.apps.events_subscriptions_v1.types.PayloadOptions):
            Optional. Options about what data to include
            in the event payload. Only supported for Google
            Chat events.
        notification_endpoint (google.apps.events_subscriptions_v1.types.NotificationEndpoint):
            Required. Immutable. The endpoint where the
            subscription delivers events, such as a Pub/Sub
            topic.
        state (google.apps.events_subscriptions_v1.types.Subscription.State):
            Output only. The state of the subscription.
            Determines whether the subscription can receive
            events and deliver them to the notification
            endpoint.
        suspension_reason (google.apps.events_subscriptions_v1.types.Subscription.ErrorType):
            Output only. The error that suspended the subscription.

            To reactivate the subscription, resolve the error and call
            the
            [``ReactivateSubscription``][google.apps.events.subscriptions.v1.SubscriptionsService.ReactivateSubscription]
            method.
        authority (str):
            Output only. The user who authorized the creation of the
            subscription.

            Format: ``users/{user}``

            For Google Workspace users, the ``{user}`` value is the
            ```user.id`` <https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users#User.FIELDS.ids>`__
            field from the Directory API.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time when the subscription
            is created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last time that the
            subscription is updated.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. If ``true``, the subscription is in the process
            of being updated.
        etag (str):
            Optional. This checksum is computed by the
            server based on the value of other fields, and
            might be sent on update requests to ensure the
            client has an up-to-date value before
            proceeding.
