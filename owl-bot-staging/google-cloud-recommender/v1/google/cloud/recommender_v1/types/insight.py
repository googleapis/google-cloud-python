            Name of the insight.
        description (str):
            Free-form human readable summary in English.

            insight is targeting.
        insight_subtype (str):
            Insight subtype. Insight content schema will
            be stable for a given subtype.
        content (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Struct):
