            J1772 type 1 connector.
        EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_TYPE_2 (3):
            IEC 62196 type 2 connector. Often referred to
            as MENNEKES.
        EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_CHADEMO (4):
            CHAdeMO type connector.

            Combined Charging System (AC and DC). Based

            The generic TESLA connector. This is NACS in

            parts of the world (e.g. CCS Combo 2 (CCS2) or
            GB/T). This value is less representative of an

            GB/T type corresponds to the GB/T standard in China. This
            type covers all GB_T types.
        EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED_WALL_OUTLET (9):
