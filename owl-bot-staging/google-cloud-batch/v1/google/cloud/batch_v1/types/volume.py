class Volume(proto.Message):
    r"""Volume describes a volume and parameters for it to be mounted
    to a VM.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        nfs (google.cloud.batch_v1.types.NFS):
            A Network File System (NFS) volume. For
            example, a Filestore file share.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        gcs (google.cloud.batch_v1.types.GCS):
            A Google Cloud Storage (GCS) volume.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        device_name (str):
            Device name of an attached disk volume, which should align
            with a device_name specified by
            job.allocation_policy.instances[0].policy.disks[i].device_name
            or defined by the given instance template in
            job.allocation_policy.instances[0].instance_template.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        mount_path (str):
            The mount path for the volume, e.g.
            /mnt/disks/share.
        mount_options (MutableSequence[str]):
            Mount options vary based on the type of storage volume:

            -  For a Cloud Storage bucket, all the mount options
               provided by the ```gcsfuse``
               tool <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcsfuse-cli>`__
               are supported.
            -  For an existing persistent disk, all mount options
               provided by the ```mount``
               command <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html>`__
               except writing are supported. This is due to restrictions
               of `multi-writer
               mode <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms>`__.
            -  For any other disk or a Network File System (NFS), all
               the mount options provided by the ``mount`` command are
               supported.
