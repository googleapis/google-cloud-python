    load balancer. It captures the ip:port over which the services
    are exposed by the proxy, along with any policy configurations.
    Routes have reference to to Gateways to dictate how requests
    should be routed by this Gateway.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. Name of the Gateway resource. It matches pattern
            ``projects/*/locations/*/gateways/<gateway_name>``.

            Output only. Server-defined URL of this
            resource
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the resource
            was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when the resource
            was updated.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Set of label tags associated with
            the Gateway resource.
        description (str):
            Optional. A free-text description of the
            resource. Max length 1024 characters.
        type_ (google.cloud.network_services_v1.types.Gateway.Type):
            Immutable. The type of the customer managed
            gateway. This field is required. If unspecified,
            an error is returned.
        ports (MutableSequence[int]):
            Required. One or more ports that the Gateway
            must receive traffic on. The proxy binds to the
            ports specified. Gateway listen on 0.0.0.0 on
            the ports specified below.
        scope (str):
            Required. Immutable. Scope determines how
            configuration across multiple Gateway instances
            are merged. The configuration for multiple
            Gateway instances with the same scope will be
            merged as presented as a single coniguration to
            the proxy/load balancer.

            Max length 64 characters.
            Scope should start with a letter and can only
            have letters, numbers, hyphens.
        server_tls_policy (str):
            Optional. A fully-qualified ServerTLSPolicy
            URL reference. Specifies how TLS traffic is
