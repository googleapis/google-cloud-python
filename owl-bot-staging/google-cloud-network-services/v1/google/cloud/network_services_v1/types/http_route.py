            was updated.
        hostnames (MutableSequence[str]):
            Required. Hostnames define a set of hosts that should match
            against the HTTP host header to select a HttpRoute to
            process the request. Hostname is the fully qualified domain
            name of a network host, as defined by RFC 1123 with the
            exception that:

            -  IPs are not allowed.
            -  A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label
               (``*.``). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the
               first label.

            Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the
            terminating dot of a network host (e.g. ``foo.example.com``)
            or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single
            wildcard label (e.g. ``*.example.com``).

            Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist
            of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start
            and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation
            is allowed.

            The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways must have
            unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes
            with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be
            rejected.

            For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the
            hostnames ``*.foo.bar.com`` and ``*.bar.com`` to be
            associated with the same Mesh (or Gateways under the same
            scope), it is not possible to associate two routes both with
            ``*.bar.com`` or both with ``bar.com``.
        meshes (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. Meshes defines a list of meshes this HttpRoute is
            attached to, as one of the routing rules to route the
            requests served by the mesh.

            Each mesh reference should match the pattern:
            ``projects/*/locations/global/meshes/<mesh_name>``

            The attached Mesh should be of a type SIDECAR
        gateways (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. Gateways defines a list of gateways this HttpRoute
            is attached to, as one of the routing rules to route the
            requests served by the gateway.

            Each gateway reference should match the pattern:
            ``projects/*/locations/global/gateways/<gateway_name>``
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Set of label tags associated with
            the HttpRoute resource.
        rules (MutableSequence[google.cloud.network_services_v1.types.HttpRoute.RouteRule]):
            Required. Rules that define how traffic is
            routed and handled. Rules will be matched
