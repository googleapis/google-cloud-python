            Defines an endpoint that will be executed in contexts that
            don't match a declared contextual trigger. Any cards
            generated by this function will always be available to the
            user, but may be eclipsed by contextual content when this
            add-on declares more targeted triggers.

            Defines the compose time trigger for a

            causes an add-on to take action when the user is
            composing an email.
            All compose time addons are required to have the

            the add-on has all the required third-party
            authorizations, by probing the third-party APIs.
            If the probe fails, the function should throw an
            exception to initiate the authorization flow.
            This function is called before each invocation
            of the add-on, in order to ensure a smooth user
            experience.
