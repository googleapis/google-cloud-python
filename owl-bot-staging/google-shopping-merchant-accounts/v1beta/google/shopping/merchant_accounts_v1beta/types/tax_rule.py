                    cannot be negative.

    Information about tax nexus and related parameters applicable to
    orders delivered to the area covered by a single tax admin.
    Nexus is created when a merchant is doing business in an area
    administered by tax admin (only US states are supported for
    nexus configuration). If merchant has nexus in a US state,
    merchant needs to pay tax to all tax authorities associated with
    the shipping destination.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    Attributes:
        location_id (int):
            The admin_id or criteria_id of the region in which this rule

            The range of postal codes in which this rule
            is applicable.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``location``.
        use_google_rate (bool):
            Rate that depends on delivery location: if
            merchant has a nexus in corresponding US state,
            rates from authorities with jurisdiction over
            delivery area are added up.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``rate_calculation``.

            A fixed rate specified in micros, where 100% = 1_000_000.

            If set, shipping charge is taxed (at the same

            open ended to the future. The start of this time period is
            inclusive, and the end is exclusive.
