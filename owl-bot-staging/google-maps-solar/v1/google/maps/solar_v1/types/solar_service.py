            roof segment. Because the orientations of these parts are

    Attributes:
        location (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            Required. The longitude and latitude for the
            center of the region to get data for.
        radius_meters (float):
            Required. The radius, in meters, defining the region
            surrounding that centre point for which data should be
            returned. The limitations on this value are:

            -  Any value up to 100m can always be specified.
            -  Values over 100m can be specified, as long as
               ``radius_meters`` <= ``pixel_size_meters * 1000``.
            -  However, for values over 175m, the ``DataLayerView`` in
               the request must not include monthly flux or hourly
               shade.
        view (google.maps.solar_v1.types.DataLayerView):
            Optional. The desired subset of the data to
            return.
        required_quality (google.maps.solar_v1.types.ImageryQuality):
            Optional. The minimum quality level allowed
            in the results. No result with lower quality
            than this will be returned. Not specifying this
            is equivalent to restricting to HIGH quality
            only.
        pixel_size_meters (float):
            Optional. The minimum scale, in meters per pixel, of the
            data to return. Values of 0.1 (the default, if this field is
            not set explicitly), 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 are supported.
            Imagery components whose normal resolution is less than
            ``pixel_size_meters`` will be returned at the resolution
            specified by ``pixel_size_meters``; imagery components whose
            normal resolution is equal to or greater than
            ``pixel_size_meters`` will be returned at that normal
            resolution.
        exact_quality_required (bool):
            Optional. Whether to require exact quality of the imagery.
            If set to false, the ``required_quality`` field is
            interpreted as the minimum required quality, such that HIGH
            quality imagery may be returned when ``required_quality`` is
            set to MEDIUM. If set to true, ``required_quality`` is
            interpreted as the exact required quality and only
            ``MEDIUM`` quality imagery is returned if
            ``required_quality`` is set to ``MEDIUM``.

    r"""Information about the solar potential of a region. The actual data
    are contained in a number of GeoTIFF files covering the requested
    region, for which this message contains URLs: Each string in the
    ``DataLayers`` message contains a URL from which the corresponding
    GeoTIFF can be fetched. These URLs are valid for a few hours after
    they've been generated. Most of the GeoTIFF files are at a
    resolution of 0.1m/pixel, but the monthly flux file is at
    0.5m/pixel, and the hourly shade files are at 1m/pixel. If a
    ``pixel_size_meters`` value was specified in the
    ``GetDataLayersRequest``, then the minimum resolution in the GeoTIFF
    files will be that value.

    Attributes:
        imagery_date (google.type.date_pb2.Date):
            When the source imagery (from which all the
            other data are derived) in this region was
            taken. It is necessarily somewhat approximate,
            as the images may have been taken over more than
            one day.
        imagery_processed_date (google.type.date_pb2.Date):
            When processing was completed on this
            imagery.
        dsm_url (str):
            The URL for an image of the DSM (Digital
            Surface Model) of the region. Values are in
            meters above EGM96 geoid (i.e., sea level).
            Invalid locations (where we don't have data) are
            stored as -9999.
        rgb_url (str):
            The URL for an image of RGB data (aerial
            photo) of the region.
        mask_url (str):
            The URL for the building mask image: one bit
            per pixel saying whether that pixel is
            considered to be part of a rooftop or not.
        annual_flux_url (str):
            The URL for the annual flux map (annual sunlight on roofs)
            of the region. Values are kWh/kW/year. This is *unmasked
            flux*: flux is computed for every location, not just
            building rooftops. Invalid locations are stored as -9999:
            locations outside our coverage area will be invalid, and a
            few locations inside the coverage area, where we were unable
            to calculate flux, will also be invalid.
        monthly_flux_url (str):
            The URL for the monthly flux map (sunlight on
            roofs, broken down by month) of the region.
            Values are kWh/kW/year. The GeoTIFF pointed to
            by this URL will contain twelve bands,
            corresponding to January...December, in order.
        hourly_shade_urls (MutableSequence[str]):
            Twelve URLs for hourly shade, corresponding to
            January...December, in order. Each GeoTIFF will contain 24
            bands, corresponding to the 24 hours of the day. Each pixel
            is a 32 bit integer, corresponding to the (up to) 31 days of
            that month; a 1 bit means that the corresponding location is
            able to see the sun at that day, of that hour, of that
            month. Invalid locations are stored as -9999 (since this is
            negative, it has bit 31 set, and no valid value could have
            bit 31 set as that would correspond to the 32nd day of the
            month).

            An example may be useful. If you want to know whether a
            point (at pixel location (x, y)) saw sun at 4pm on the 22nd
            of June you would:

            1. fetch the sixth URL in this list (corresponding to June).
            2. look up the 17th channel (corresponding to 4pm).
            3. read the 32-bit value at (x, y).
            4. read bit 21 of the value (corresponding to the 22nd of
               the month).
            5. if that bit is a 1, then that spot saw the sun at 4pm 22
               June.

            More formally: Given ``month`` (1-12), ``day`` (1...month
            max; February has 28 days) and ``hour`` (0-23), the
            shade/sun for that month/day/hour at a position ``(x, y)``
            is the bit

            ::

               (hourly_shade[month - 1])(x, y)[hour] & (1 << (day - 1))

            where ``(x, y)`` is spatial indexing, ``[month - 1]`` refers
            to fetching the ``month - 1``\ st URL (indexing from zero),
            ``[hour]`` is indexing into the channels, and a final
            non-zero result means "sunny". There are no leap days, and
            DST doesn't exist (all days are 24 hours long; noon is
            always "standard time" noon).
        imagery_quality (google.maps.solar_v1.types.ImageryQuality):
            The quality of the result's imagery.
