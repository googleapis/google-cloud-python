transport inheritance structure
_______________________________

`WarehouseTransport` is the ABC for all transports.
- public child `WarehouseGrpcTransport` for sync gRPC transport (defined in `grpc.py`).
- public child `WarehouseGrpcAsyncIOTransport` for async gRPC transport (defined in `grpc_asyncio.py`).
- private child `_BaseWarehouseRestTransport` for base REST transport with inner classes `_BaseMETHOD` (defined in `rest_base.py`).
- public child `WarehouseRestTransport` for sync REST transport with inner classes `METHOD` derived from the parent's corresponding `_BaseMETHOD` classes (defined in `rest.py`).
