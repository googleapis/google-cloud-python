class DeliveryVehicle(proto.Message):
    r"""The ``DeliveryVehicle`` message. A delivery vehicle transports
    shipments from a depot to a delivery location, and from a pickup
    location to the depot. In some cases, delivery vehicles also
    transport shipments directly from the pickup location to the
    delivery location.

    Note: gRPC and REST APIs use different field naming conventions. For
    example, the ``DeliveryVehicle.current_route_segment`` field in the
    gRPC API and the ``DeliveryVehicle.currentRouteSegment`` field in
    the REST API refer to the same field.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The unique name of this Delivery Vehicle. The format is
            ``providers/{provider}/deliveryVehicles/{vehicle}``.
        last_location (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.DeliveryVehicleLocation):
            The last reported location of the Delivery
            Vehicle.
        navigation_status (google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.DeliveryVehicleNavigationStatus):
            The Delivery Vehicle's navigation status.
        current_route_segment (bytes):
            The encoded polyline specifying the route that the
            navigation recommends taking to the next waypoint. Your
            driver app updates this when a stop is reached or passed,
            and when the navigation reroutes. These ``LatLng``\ s are
            returned in
            ``Task.journey_sharing_info.remaining_vehicle_journey_segments[0].path``
            (gRPC) or
            ``Task.journeySharingInfo.remainingVehicleJourneySegments[0].path``
            (REST) for all active Tasks assigned to the Vehicle.

            There are a few cases where this field might not be used to
            populate
            ``Task.journey_sharing_info.remaining_vehicle_journey_segments[0].path``
            (gRPC) or
            ``Task.journeySharingInfo.remainingVehicleJourneySegments[0].path``
            (REST):

            -  The endpoint of the ``current_route_segment`` does not
               match
               ``DeliveryVehicle.remaining_vehicle_journey_segments[0].stop``
               (gRPC) or
               ``DeliveryVehicle.remainingVehicleJourneySegments[0].stop``
               (REST).

            -  The driver app has not updated its location recently, so
               the last updated value for this field might be stale.

            -  The driver app has recently updated its location, but the
               ``current_route_segment`` is stale, and points to a
               previous vehicle stop.

            In these cases, Fleet Engine populates this field with a
            route from the most recently passed VehicleStop to the
            upcoming VehicleStop to ensure that the consumer of this
            field has the best available information on the current path
            of the Delivery Vehicle.
        current_route_segment_end_point (google.type.latlng_pb2.LatLng):
            The location where the ``current_route_segment`` ends. This
            is not currently populated by the driver app, but you can
            supply it on ``UpdateDeliveryVehicle`` calls. It is either
            the ``LatLng`` from the upcoming vehicle stop, or the last
            ``LatLng`` of the ``current_route_segment``. Fleet Engine
            will then do its best to interpolate to an actual
            ``VehicleStop``.

            This field is ignored in ``UpdateDeliveryVehicle`` calls if
            the ``current_route_segment`` field is empty.
        remaining_distance_meters (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            The remaining driving distance for the
            ``current_route_segment``. The Driver app typically provides
            this field, but there are some circumstances in which Fleet
            Engine will override the value sent by the app. For more
            information, see
            [DeliveryVehicle.current_route_segment][maps.fleetengine.delivery.v1.DeliveryVehicle.current_route_segment].
            This field is returned in
            ``Task.remaining_vehicle_journey_segments[0].driving_distance_meters``
            (gRPC) or
            ``Task.remainingVehicleJourneySegments[0].drivingDistanceMeters``
            (REST) for all active ``Task``\ s assigned to the Delivery
            Vehicle.

            Fleet Engine ignores this field in
            ``UpdateDeliveryVehicleRequest`` if the
            ``current_route_segment`` field is empty.
        remaining_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The remaining driving time for the
            ``current_route_segment``. The Driver app typically provides
            this field, but there are some circumstances in which Fleet
            Engine will override the value sent by the app. For more
            information, see
            [DeliveryVehicle.current_route_segment][maps.fleetengine.delivery.v1.DeliveryVehicle.current_route_segment].
            This field is returned in
            ``Task.remaining_vehicle_journey_segments[0].driving_duration``
            (gRPC) or
            ``Task.remainingVehicleJourneySegments[0].drivingDuration``
            (REST) for all active tasks assigned to the Delivery
            Vehicle.

            Fleet Engine ignores this field in
            ``UpdateDeliveryVehicleRequest`` if the
            ``current_route_segment`` field is empty.
        remaining_vehicle_journey_segments (MutableSequence[google.maps.fleetengine_delivery_v1.types.VehicleJourneySegment]):

            A Delivery Vehicle can have at most 100
