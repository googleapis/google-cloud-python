    class Phrase(proto.Message):
        r"""A phrases containing words and phrase "hints" so that the speech
        recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to
        improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
        specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be
        used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer.
        See `usage
        limits <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas#content>`__.

        List items can also include pre-built or custom classes containing
        groups of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural
        language. For example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every
        month of the year (e.g. "i was born in january", "i was born in
        febuary", ...), use the pre-built ``$MONTH`` class improves the
        likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months
        (e.g. "i was born in $month"). To refer to pre-built classes, use
        the class' symbol prepended with ``$`` e.g. ``$MONTH``. To refer to
        custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the
        class's ``custom_class_id`` to a string unique to all class
        resources and inline classes. Then use the class' id wrapped in
        $\ ``{...}`` e.g. "${my-months}". To refer to custom classes
        resources, use the class' id wrapped in ``${}`` (e.g.
        ``${my-months}``).

        Speech-to-Text supports three locations: ``global``, ``us`` (US
        North America), and ``eu`` (Europe). If you are calling the
        ``speech.googleapis.com`` endpoint, use the ``global`` location. To
        specify a region, use a `regional
        endpoint <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/endpoints>`__
        with matching ``us`` or ``eu`` location value.

                Hint Boost. Overrides the boost set at the phrase set level.
                Positive value will increase the probability that a specific
                phrase will be recognized over other similar sounding
                phrases. The higher the boost, the higher the chance of
