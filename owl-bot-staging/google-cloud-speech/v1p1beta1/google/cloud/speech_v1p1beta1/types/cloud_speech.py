            ``RecognitionAudio`` messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000.
            16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of
            the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use

            re-sampling). This field is optional for FLAC and WAV audio
            files, but is required for all other audio formats. For
            details, see
            [AudioEncoding][google.cloud.speech.v1p1beta1.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding].
        audio_channel_count (int):

            this for MULTI-CHANNEL recognition. Valid values for
            LINEAR16, OGG_OPUS and FLAC are ``1``-``8``. Valid value for

            If ``0`` or omitted, defaults to one channel (mono). Note:
            We only recognize the first channel by default. To perform
            independent recognition on each channel set
            ``enable_separate_recognition_per_channel`` to 'true'.
        enable_separate_recognition_per_channel (bool):
            This needs to be set to ``true`` explicitly and
            ``audio_channel_count`` > 1 to get each channel recognized
            separately. The recognition result will contain a
            ``channel_tag`` field to state which channel that result
            belongs to. If this is not true, we will only recognize the
            first channel. The request is billed cumulatively for all
            channels recognized: ``audio_channel_count`` multiplied by
            the length of the audio.
        language_code (str):
            Required. The language of the supplied audio as a
            `BCP-47 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt>`__
            language tag. Example: "en-US". See `Language
            Support <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages>`__
            for a list of the currently supported language codes.
        alternative_language_codes (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of up to 3 additional
            `BCP-47 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt>`__
            language tags, listing possible alternative languages of the
            supplied audio. See `Language
            Support <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages>`__
            for a list of the currently supported language codes. If
            alternative languages are listed, recognition result will
            contain recognition in the most likely language detected
            including the main language_code. The recognition result
            will include the language tag of the language detected in
            the audio. Note: This feature is only supported for Voice
            Command and Voice Search use cases and performance may vary
            for other use cases (e.g., phone call transcription).
        max_alternatives (int):
            Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned.
            Specifically, the maximum number of
            ``SpeechRecognitionAlternative`` messages within each
            ``SpeechRecognitionResult``. The server may return fewer
            than ``max_alternatives``. Valid values are ``0``-``30``. A
            value of ``0`` or ``1`` will return a maximum of one. If
            omitted, will return a maximum of one.
        profanity_filter (bool):
            If set to ``true``, the server will attempt to filter out
            profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each
            filtered word with asterisks, e.g. "f***". If set to
            ``false`` or omitted, profanities won't be filtered out.
        adaptation (google.cloud.speech_v1p1beta1.types.SpeechAdaptation):
            Speech adaptation configuration improves the accuracy of
            speech recognition. For more information, see the `speech
            adaptation <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/adaptation>`__
            documentation. When speech adaptation is set it supersedes
            the ``speech_contexts`` field.
        transcript_normalization (google.cloud.speech_v1p1beta1.types.TranscriptNormalization):
            Use transcription normalization to
            automatically replace parts of the transcript
            with phrases of your choosing. For
            StreamingRecognize, this normalization only
            applies to stable partial transcripts (stability
            > 0.8) and final transcripts.
        speech_contexts (MutableSequence[google.cloud.speech_v1p1beta1.types.SpeechContext]):
            Array of
            [SpeechContext][google.cloud.speech.v1p1beta1.SpeechContext].
            A means to provide context to assist the speech recognition.
            For more information, see `speech
            adaptation <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/adaptation>`__.
        enable_word_time_offsets (bool):
            If ``true``, the top result includes a list of words and the
            start and end time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If
            ``false``, no word-level time offset information is
            returned. The default is ``false``.
        enable_word_confidence (bool):
            If ``true``, the top result includes a list of words and the
            confidence for those words. If ``false``, no word-level
            confidence information is returned. The default is
            ``false``.
        enable_automatic_punctuation (bool):
            If 'true', adds punctuation to recognition
            result hypotheses. This feature is only
            available in select languages. Setting this for
            requests in other languages has no effect at
            all. The default 'false' value does not add
            punctuation to result hypotheses.
        enable_spoken_punctuation (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            The spoken punctuation behavior for the call If not set,
            uses default behavior based on model of choice e.g.
            command_and_search will enable spoken punctuation by default
            If 'true', replaces spoken punctuation with the
            corresponding symbols in the request. For example, "how are
            you question mark" becomes "how are you?". See
            https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/spoken-punctuation
            for support. If 'false', spoken punctuation is not replaced.
        enable_spoken_emojis (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            The spoken emoji behavior for the call
            If not set, uses default behavior based on model
            of choice If 'true', adds spoken emoji
            formatting for the request. This will replace
            spoken emojis with the corresponding Unicode
            symbols in the final transcript. If 'false',
            spoken emojis are not replaced.
        enable_speaker_diarization (bool):
            If 'true', enables speaker detection for each recognized
            word in the top alternative of the recognition result using
            a speaker_tag provided in the WordInfo. Note: Use
            diarization_config instead.
        diarization_speaker_count (int):
            If set, specifies the estimated number of speakers in the
            conversation. Defaults to '2'. Ignored unless
            enable_speaker_diarization is set to true. Note: Use
            diarization_config instead.
        diarization_config (google.cloud.speech_v1p1beta1.types.SpeakerDiarizationConfig):
            Config to enable speaker diarization and set
            additional parameters to make diarization better
            suited for your application. Note: When this is
            enabled, we send all the words from the
            beginning of the audio for the top alternative
            in every consecutive STREAMING responses. This
            is done in order to improve our speaker tags as
            our models learn to identify the speakers in the
            conversation over time. For non-streaming
            requests, the diarization results will be
            provided only in the top alternative of the
            FINAL SpeechRecognitionResult.
        metadata (google.cloud.speech_v1p1beta1.types.RecognitionMetadata):
            Metadata regarding this request.
        model (str):
            Which model to select for the given request. Select the
            model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a
            model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a
            model based on the parameters in the RecognitionConfig.

    class AudioEncoding(proto.Enum):
        r"""The encoding of the audio data sent in the request.

        All encodings support only 1 channel (mono) audio, unless the
        ``audio_channel_count`` and
        ``enable_separate_recognition_per_channel`` fields are set.

        For best results, the audio source should be captured and
        transmitted using a lossless encoding (``FLAC`` or ``LINEAR16``).
        The accuracy of the speech recognition can be reduced if lossy
        codecs are used to capture or transmit audio, particularly if
        background noise is present. Lossy codecs include ``MULAW``,
        ``AMR``, ``AMR_WB``, ``OGG_OPUS``, ``SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE``,
        ``MP3``, and ``WEBM_OPUS``.

        The ``FLAC`` and ``WAV`` audio file formats include a header that
        describes the included audio content. You can request recognition
        for ``WAV`` files that contain either ``LINEAR16`` or ``MULAW``
        encoded audio. If you send ``FLAC`` or ``WAV`` audio file format in
        your request, you do not need to specify an ``AudioEncoding``; the
        audio encoding format is determined from the file header. If you
        specify an ``AudioEncoding`` when you send send ``FLAC`` or ``WAV``
        audio, the encoding configuration must match the encoding described
        in the audio header; otherwise the request returns an
        [google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT][google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT]
        error code.

        Values:
            ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Not specified.
            LINEAR16 (1):
                Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian
                samples (Linear PCM).
            FLAC (2):
                ``FLAC`` (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended
                encoding because it is lossless--therefore recognition is
                not compromised--and requires only about half the bandwidth
                of ``LINEAR16``. ``FLAC`` stream encoding supports 16-bit
                and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields in
                ``STREAMINFO`` are supported.
            MULAW (3):
                8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio
                samples using G.711 PCMU/mu-law.
            AMR (4):
                Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. ``sample_rate_hertz``
                must be 8000.
            AMR_WB (5):
                Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. ``sample_rate_hertz``
                must be 16000.
            OGG_OPUS (6):
                Opus encoded audio frames in Ogg container
                (`OggOpus <https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus>`__).
                ``sample_rate_hertz`` must be one of 8000, 12000, 16000,
                24000, or 48000.
            SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE (7):
                Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a
                very low bitrate encoding is required, ``OGG_OPUS`` is
                highly preferred over Speex encoding. The
                `Speex <https://speex.org/>`__ encoding supported by Cloud
                Speech API has a header byte in each block, as in MIME type
                ``audio/x-speex-with-header-byte``. It is a variant of the
                RTP Speex encoding defined in `RFC
                5574 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574>`__. The stream is
                a sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block
                starts with a byte containing the length of the block, in
                bytes, followed by one or more frames of Speex data, padded
                to an integral number of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC
                5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced with a
                single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband
                is supported. ``sample_rate_hertz`` must be 16000.
            MP3 (8):
                MP3 audio. MP3 encoding is a Beta feature and only available
                in v1p1beta1. Support all standard MP3 bitrates (which range
                from 32-320 kbps). When using this encoding,
                ``sample_rate_hertz`` has to match the sample rate of the
                file being used.
            WEBM_OPUS (9):
                Opus encoded audio frames in WebM container
                (`OggOpus <https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus>`__).
                ``sample_rate_hertz`` must be one of 8000, 12000, 16000,
                24000, or 48000.

    Attributes:
        phrases (MutableSequence[str]):
            A list of strings containing words and phrases "hints" so
            that the speech recognition is more likely to recognize
            them. This can be used to improve the accuracy for specific
            words and phrases, for example, if specific commands are
            typically spoken by the user. This can also be used to add
            additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
            `usage
            limits <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas#content>`__.

            List items can also be set to classes for groups of words
            that represent common concepts that occur in natural
            language. For example, rather than providing phrase hints
            for every month of the year, using the $MONTH class improves
            the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes
            months.
        boost (float):
            Hint Boost. Positive value will increase the probability
            that a specific phrase will be recognized over other similar
            sounding phrases. The higher the boost, the higher the
            chance of false positive recognition as well. Negative boost
            values would correspond to anti-biasing. Anti-biasing is not
            enabled, so negative boost will simply be ignored. Though
            ``boost`` can accept a wide range of positive values, most
            use cases are best served with values between 0 and 20. We
            recommend using a binary search approach to finding the
            optimal value for your use case.
