    method.

    Attributes:
        data_store (str):
            Required. The parent data store resource name for which the
            completion is performed, such as
            ``projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/default_data_store``.
        query (str):
            Required. The typeahead input used to fetch
            suggestions. Maximum length is 128 characters.
        query_model (str):
            Specifies the autocomplete data model. This overrides any
            model specified in the Configuration > Autocomplete section
            of the Cloud console. Currently supported values:

            -  ``document`` - Using suggestions generated from
               user-imported documents.
            -  ``search-history`` - Using suggestions generated from the
               past history of
               [SearchService.Search][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.SearchService.Search]
               API calls. Do not use it when there is no traffic for
               Search API.
            -  ``user-event`` - Using suggestions generated from
               user-imported search events.
            -  ``document-completable`` - Using suggestions taken
               directly from user-imported document fields marked as
               completable.

            Default values:

            -  ``document`` is the default model for regular dataStores.
            -  ``search-history`` is the default model for site search
               dataStores.
        user_pseudo_id (str):
            A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this
            could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be
            able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This
            unique identifier should not change if the visitor logs in
            or out of the website.

            This field should NOT have a fixed value such as
            ``unknown_visitor``.

            This should be the same identifier as
            [UserEvent.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.UserEvent.user_pseudo_id]
            and
            [SearchRequest.user_pseudo_id][google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.SearchRequest.user_pseudo_id].

            The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit
            of 128 characters. Otherwise, an ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error
            is returned.
        include_tail_suggestions (bool):
            Indicates if tail suggestions should be
            returned if there are no suggestions that match
            the full query. Even if set to true, if there
            are suggestions that match the full query, those
            are returned and no tail suggestions are
            returned.
