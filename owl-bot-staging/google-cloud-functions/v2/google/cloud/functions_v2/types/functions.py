            function is not completed at the end of the
            timeout period. Defaults to 60 seconds.

            k, M, G, Mi, Gi. If no unit is supplied the

            a full description.
        available_cpu (str):
            The number of CPUs used in a single container
            instance. Default value is calculated from
            available memory. Supports the same values as
            Cloud Run, see
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v1/Container#resourcerequirements
            Example: "1" indicates 1 vCPU
        environment_variables (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Environment variables that shall be available
            during function execution.
        max_instance_count (int):
            The limit on the maximum number of function instances that
            may coexist at a given time.

            In some cases, such as rapid traffic surges, Cloud Functions
            may, for a short period of time, create more instances than
            the specified max instances limit. If your function cannot
            tolerate this temporary behavior, you may want to factor in
            a safety margin and set a lower max instances value than
            your function can tolerate.

            See the `Max
            Instances <https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/max-instances>`__
            Guide for more details.
        min_instance_count (int):
            The limit on the minimum number of function
            instances that may coexist at a given time.

            Function instances are kept in idle state for a
            short period after they finished executing the
            request to reduce cold start time for subsequent
            requests. Setting a minimum instance count will
            ensure that the given number of instances are
            kept running in idle state always. This can help
            with cold start times when jump in incoming
            request count occurs after the idle instance
            would have been stopped in the default case.

            The ingress settings for the function,
            controlling what traffic can reach it.

            Output only. URI of the Service deployed.

            The email of the service's service account. If empty,
            defaults to

        all_traffic_on_latest_revision (bool):
            Whether 100% of traffic is routed to the
            latest revision. On CreateFunction and
            UpdateFunction, when set to true, the revision
            being deployed will serve 100% of traffic,
            ignoring any traffic split settings, if any. On
            GetFunction, true will be returned if the latest
            revision is serving 100% of traffic.

            Security level configure whether the function
            only accepts https. This configuration is only
            applicable to 1st Gen functions with Http
            trigger. By default https is optional for 1st
