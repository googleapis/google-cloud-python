    will be assigned.

    What fields can be updated depends on the start time and end time of
    the ``Snooze``.

    -  end time is in the past: These ``Snooze``\ s are considered
       read-only and cannot be updated.
    -  start time is in the past and end time is in the future:
       ``display_name`` and ``interval.end_time`` can be updated.
    -  start time is in the future: ``display_name``,
       ``interval.start_time`` and ``interval.end_time`` can be updated.

    Attributes:
        snooze (google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Snooze):
            Required. The ``Snooze`` to update. Must have the name field
            present.
        update_mask (google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask):
            Required. The fields to update.

            For each field listed in ``update_mask``:

            -  If the ``Snooze`` object supplied in the
               ``UpdateSnoozeRequest`` has a value for that field, the
               value of the field in the existing ``Snooze`` will be set
               to the value of the field in the supplied ``Snooze``.
            -  If the field does not have a value in the supplied
               ``Snooze``, the field in the existing ``Snooze`` is set
               to its default value.

            Fields not listed retain their existing value.

            The following are the field names that are accepted in
            ``update_mask``:

            -  ``display_name``
            -  ``interval.start_time``
            -  ``interval.end_time``

            That said, the start time and end time of the ``Snooze``
            determines which fields can legally be updated. Before
            attempting an update, users should consult the documentation
            for ``UpdateSnoozeRequest``, which talks about which fields
            can be updated.
