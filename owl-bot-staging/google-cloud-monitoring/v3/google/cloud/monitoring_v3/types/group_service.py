            Returns groups whose ``parent_name`` field contains the
            group name. If no groups have this parent, the results are
            empty.

            Returns groups that are ancestors of the specified group.
            The groups are returned in order, starting with the
            immediate parent and ending with the most distant ancestor.
            If the specified group has no immediate parent, the results
            are empty.

            superset of the results returned by the
            ``children_of_group`` filter, and includes
