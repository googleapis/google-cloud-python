                configurations result in errors:

                1. Content type is specified in both the ``headers`` field
                   and the ``content_type`` field.

                The invalid configurations outlined in the ``content_type``
                field apply to ``custom_content_type``, as well as the

                Boolean specifying whether to include SSL certificate

                checks where ``monitored_resource`` is set to
                ``uptime_url``. If ``use_ssl`` is ``false``, setting
                ``validate_ssl`` to ``true`` has no effect.
            body (bytes):
                The request body associated with the HTTP POST request. If
                ``content_type`` is ``URL_ENCODED``, the body passed in must
                be URL-encoded. Users can provide a ``Content-Length``
                header via the ``headers`` field or the API will do so. If
                the ``request_method`` is ``GET`` and ``body`` is not empty,
                the API will return an error. The maximum byte size is 1
                megabyte.

                Note: If client libraries aren't used (which performs the
                conversion automatically) base64 encode your ``body`` data
                since the field is of ``bytes`` type.

                status codes. If empty, the HTTP status code
