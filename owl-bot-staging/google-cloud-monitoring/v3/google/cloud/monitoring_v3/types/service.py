    is defined to be ``good_service / total_service`` over any queried
    time interval. The value of performance always falls into the range
    ``0 <= performance <= 1``. A custom SLI describes how to compute
    this ratio, whether this is by dividing values from a pair of time
    series, cutting a ``Distribution`` into good and bad counts, or
    counting time windows in which the service complies with a
    criterion. For separation of concerns, a single Service-Level
    Indicator measures performance for only one aspect of service
    quality, such as fraction of successful queries or fast-enough
    queries.
