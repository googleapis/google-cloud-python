        max_instances (int):
            Required. Maximum number of instances for this group.
            Required for primary workers. Note that by default, clusters
            will not use secondary workers. Required for secondary
            workers if the minimum secondary instances is set.

            Primary workers - Bounds: [min_instances, ). Secondary
            workers - Bounds: [min_instances, ). Default: 0.
        weight (int):
            Optional. Weight for the instance group, which is used to
            determine the fraction of total workers in the cluster from
            this instance group. For example, if primary workers have
            weight 2, and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster
            will have approximately 2 primary workers for each secondary
            worker.

            The cluster may not reach the specified balance if
            constrained by min/max bounds or other autoscaling settings.
            For example, if ``max_instances`` for secondary workers is
            0, then only primary workers will be added. The cluster can
            also be out of balance when created.

            If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will
            default to equal weight for all groups: the cluster will
            attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group
            within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight
            is set for one group only, the cluster will default to zero
            weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set only
            on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers
            only and no secondary workers.
