            Required. The relative name of an asset. The search is
            limited to the resources within the ``scope``. The allowed
            value must be:

            -  Project number (such as "projects/12345")
            -  Project ID (such as "projects/abc")
        query (str):
            Optional. The query statement.
        asset_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. A list of asset types that this
            request searches for. If empty, it will search
            all the supported asset types.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page
            size is capped at 500 even if a larger value is given. If
            set to zero, server will pick an appropriate default.
            Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this
            happens, there could be more results as long as
            ``next_page_token`` is returned.
        page_token (str):
            Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of
            results from the preceding call to this method.
            ``page_token`` must be the value of ``next_page_token`` from
            the previous response. The values of all other method
            parameters, must be identical to those in the previous call.
        order_by (str):
            Optional. A comma separated list of fields specifying the
            sorting order of the results. The default order is
            ascending. Add ``DESC`` after the field name to indicate
            descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.
            For example, ``location DESC , name``.
