    r"""An asset in Google Cloud. An asset can be any resource in the Google
    Cloud `resource
    hierarchy <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy>`__,
    a resource outside the Google Cloud resource hierarchy (such as
    Google Kubernetes Engine clusters and objects), or a policy (e.g.
    IAM policy). See `Supported asset
    types <https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types>`__
    for more information.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The full name of the asset. Example:
            ``//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1``

            See `Resource
            names <https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name>`__

            A representation of the resource.
        iam_policy (google.iam.v1.policy_pb2.Policy):
            A representation of the IAM policy set on a Google Cloud
            resource. There can be a maximum of one IAM policy set on
            any given resource. In addition, IAM policies inherit their
            granted access scope from any policies set on parent
            resources in the resource hierarchy. Therefore, the
            effectively policy is the union of both the policy set on
            this resource and each policy set on all of the resource's
            ancestry resource levels in the hierarchy. See `this

            There can be more than one organization policy with
            different constraints set on a given resource.

            hierarchy and ends at root. If the asset is a project,
            folder, or organization, the ancestry path starts from the
            asset itself.
