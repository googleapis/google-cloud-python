class Case(proto.Message):
    r"""A support case.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The resource name for the case.
        display_name (str):
            The short summary of the issue reported in
            this case.
        description (str):
            A broad description of the issue.
        classification (google.cloud.support_v2.types.CaseClassification):
            The issue classification applicable to this
            case.
        time_zone (str):
            The timezone of the user who created the
            support case. It should be in a format IANA
            recognizes: https://www.iana.org/time-zones.
            There is no additional validation done by the
            API.
        subscriber_email_addresses (MutableSequence[str]):
            The email addresses to receive updates on
            this case.
        state (google.cloud.support_v2.types.Case.State):
            Output only. The current status of the
            support case.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time this case was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time this case was last
            updated.
        creator (google.cloud.support_v2.types.Actor):
            The user who created the case.

            Note: The name and email will be obfuscated if
            the case was created by Google Support.
        contact_email (str):
            A user-supplied email address to send case
            update notifications for. This should only be
            used in BYOID flows, where we cannot infer the
            user's email address directly from their EUCs.
        escalated (bool):
            Whether the case is currently escalated.
        test_case (bool):
            Whether this case was created for internal
            API testing and should not be acted on by the
            support team.
        language_code (str):
            The language the user has requested to receive support in.
            This should be a BCP 47 language code (e.g., ``"en"``,
            ``"zh-CN"``, ``"zh-TW"``, ``"ja"``, ``"ko"``). If no
            language or an unsupported language is specified, this field
            defaults to English (en).

            Language selection during case creation may affect your
            available support options. For a list of supported languages
            and their support working hours, see:
            https://cloud.google.com/support/docs/language-working-hours
        priority (google.cloud.support_v2.types.Case.Priority):
            The priority of this case.
