transport inheritance structure
_______________________________

`LfpSaleServiceTransport` is the ABC for all transports.
- public child `LfpSaleServiceGrpcTransport` for sync gRPC transport (defined in `grpc.py`).
- public child `LfpSaleServiceGrpcAsyncIOTransport` for async gRPC transport (defined in `grpc_asyncio.py`).
- private child `_BaseLfpSaleServiceRestTransport` for base REST transport with inner classes `_BaseMETHOD` (defined in `rest_base.py`).
- public child `LfpSaleServiceRestTransport` for sync REST transport with inner classes `METHOD` derived from the parent's corresponding `_BaseMETHOD` classes (defined in `rest.py`).
