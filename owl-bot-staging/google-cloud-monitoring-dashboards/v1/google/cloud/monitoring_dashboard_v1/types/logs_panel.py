            A filter that chooses which log entries to return. See
            `Advanced Logs
            Queries <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries>`__.
            Only log entries that match the filter are returned. An
            empty filter matches all log entries.
        resource_names (MutableSequence[str]):
            The names of logging resources to collect
            logs for. Currently only projects are supported.
            If empty, the widget will default to the host
            project.
