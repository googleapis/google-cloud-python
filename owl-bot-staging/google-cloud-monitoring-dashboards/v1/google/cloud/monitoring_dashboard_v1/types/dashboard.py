class Dashboard(proto.Message):
    r"""A Google Stackdriver dashboard. Dashboards define the content
    and layout of pages in the Stackdriver web application.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Identifier. The resource name of the
            dashboard.
        display_name (str):
            Required. The mutable, human-readable name.
        etag (str):
            ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way
            to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from
            overwriting each other. An ``etag`` is returned in the
            response to ``GetDashboard``, and users are expected to put
            that etag in the request to ``UpdateDashboard`` to ensure
            that their change will be applied to the same version of the
            Dashboard configuration. The field should not be passed
            during dashboard creation.
        grid_layout (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.GridLayout):
            Content is arranged with a basic layout that
            re-flows a simple list of informational elements
            like widgets or tiles.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``layout``.
        mosaic_layout (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.MosaicLayout):
            The content is arranged as a grid of tiles,
            with each content widget occupying one or more
            grid blocks.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``layout``.
        row_layout (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.RowLayout):
            The content is divided into equally spaced
            rows and the widgets are arranged horizontally.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``layout``.
        column_layout (google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.ColumnLayout):
            The content is divided into equally spaced
            columns and the widgets are arranged vertically.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``layout``.
        dashboard_filters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.monitoring_dashboard_v1.types.DashboardFilter]):
            Filters to reduce the amount of data charted
            based on the filter criteria.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Labels applied to the dashboard
