    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. The resource name of the private cloud to be
            queried for clusters. Resource names are schemeless URIs
            that follow the conventions in
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For
            example: ``projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a``
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of private clouds to
            return in one page. The service may return fewer
            than this value. The maximum value is coerced to
            1000.
            The default value of this field is 500.
        page_token (str):
            A page token, received from a previous ``ListPrivateClouds``
            call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            ``ListPrivateClouds`` must match the call that provided the
            page token.
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds,
            you can exclude the ones named ``example-pc`` by specifying
            ``name != "example-pc"``.

            You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could
            specify ``networkConfig.managementCidr = "192.168.0.0/24"``
            to include private clouds only if they have a matching
            address in their network configuration.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-pc")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "private-cloud-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
               (name = "private-cloud-2")
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.

            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the

            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of IP addresses,
            you can exclude the ones named ``example-ip`` by specifying
            ``name != "example-ip"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

               (name = "example-ip")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-ip-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR

        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.

        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the

            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of external access
            rules, you can exclude the ones named ``example-rule`` by
            specifying ``name != "example-rule"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-rule-1") AND

            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only

        request_id (str):
            Optional. A request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been
            completed. The server guarantees that a request
            doesn't result in creation of duplicate
            commitments for at least 60 minutes.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if the original
            operation with the same request ID was received,
            and if so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    Attributes:

            Required. The resource name of the private cloud to be

            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For

            ``projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud``
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of logging servers to
            return in one page. The service may return fewer
            than this value. The maximum value is coerced to
            1000.
            The default value of this field is 500.
        page_token (str):
            A page token, received from a previous
            ``ListLoggingServersRequest`` call. Provide this to retrieve
            the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            ``ListLoggingServersRequest`` must match the call that
            provided the page token.
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of logging servers,
            you can exclude the ones named ``example-server`` by
            specifying ``name != "example-server"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-server")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-server-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
               (name = "example-server-2")
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.

            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the

        page_token (str):
            A page token, received from a previous

            subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            ``ListNetworkPeerings`` must match the call that provided

        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of network
            peerings, you can exclude the ones named ``example-peering``
            by specifying ``name != "example-peering"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

    Attributes:
        parent (str):

            schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For
            example:
            ``projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud``
        page_size (int):
            The maximum number of management DNS zone
            bindings to return in one page. The service may
            return fewer than this value. The maximum value
            is coerced to 1000.
            The default value of this field is 500.
        page_token (str):
            A page token, received from a previous
            ``ListManagementDnsZoneBindings`` call. Provide this to
            retrieve the subsequent page.

            When paginating, all other parameters provided to
            ``ListManagementDnsZoneBindings`` must match the call that
            provided the page token.
        filter (str):
            A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
            response. The expression must specify the field name, a
            comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
            filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
            boolean. The comparison operator must be ``=``, ``!=``,
            ``>``, or ``<``.

            For example, if you are filtering a list of Management DNS
            Zone Bindings, you can exclude the ones named
            ``example-management-dns-zone-binding`` by specifying
            ``name != "example-management-dns-zone-binding"``.

            To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
            expression within parentheses. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-management-dns-zone-binding")
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")

            By default, each expression is an ``AND`` expression.
            However, you can include ``AND`` and ``OR`` expressions
            explicitly. For example:

            ::

               (name = "example-management-dns-zone-binding-1") AND
               (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
               (name = "example-management-dns-zone-binding-2")
        order_by (str):
            Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
            results are ordered by ``name`` in ascending order. You can
            also sort results in descending order based on the ``name``
            value using ``orderBy="name desc"``. Currently, only
            ordering by ``name`` is supported.

            Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be
            overwritten in the ``PrivateConnection`` resource by the
            update. The fields specified in the ``update_mask`` are
            relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will
            be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not
            provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
        request_id (str):
            Optional. A request ID to identify requests.
            Specify a unique request ID so that if you must
            retry your request, the server will know to
            ignore the request if it has already been
            completed. The server guarantees that a request
            doesn't result in creation of duplicate
            commitments for at least 60 minutes.

            For example, consider a situation where you make
            an initial request and the request times out. If
            you make the request again with the same request
            ID, the server can check if original operation
            with the same request ID was received, and if
            so, will ignore the second request. This
            prevents clients from accidentally creating
            duplicate commitments.

            The request ID must be a valid UUID with the
            exception that zero UUID is not supported
