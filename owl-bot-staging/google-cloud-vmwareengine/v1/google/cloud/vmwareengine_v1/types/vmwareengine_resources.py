            address in these ranges. The specified IP addresses must
            have reserved external IP addresses in the scope of the
            parent network policy. To match all external IP addresses in
            the scope of the parent network policy, specify
            ``0.0.0.0/0``. To match a specific external IP address,
            specify it using the ``IpRange.external_address`` property.
