    r"""Provides information to the speech translation that specifies

    Attributes:
        audio_encoding (str):
            Required. Encoding of audio data. Supported formats:

            -  ``linear16``

               Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear
               PCM).

            -  ``flac``

               ``flac`` (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended
               encoding because it is lossless--therefore recognition is
               not compromised--and requires only about half the
               bandwidth of ``linear16``.

            -  ``mulaw``

               8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using
               G.711 PCMU/mu-law.

            -  ``amr``

               Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec.
               ``sample_rate_hertz`` must be 8000.

            -  ``amr-wb``

               Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. ``sample_rate_hertz``
               must be 16000.

            -  ``ogg-opus``

               Opus encoded audio frames in
               `Ogg <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg>`__ container.
               ``sample_rate_hertz`` must be one of 8000, 12000, 16000,
               24000, or 48000.

            -  ``mp3``

               MP3 audio. Support all standard MP3 bitrates (which range
               from 32-320 kbps). When using this encoding,
               ``sample_rate_hertz`` has to match the sample rate of the
               file being used.
        source_language_code (str):
            Required. Source language code (BCP-47) of
            the input audio.
        target_language_code (str):
            Required. Target language code (BCP-47) of
            the output.
        sample_rate_hertz (int):
            Optional. Sample rate in Hertz of the audio
            data. Valid values are: 8000-48000. 16000 is
            optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate
            of the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not
            possible, use the native sample rate of the
            audio source (instead of re-sampling).
        model (str):
            Optional. ``google-provided-model/video`` and
            ``google-provided-model/enhanced-phone-call`` are premium
            models. ``google-provided-model/phone-call`` is not premium
            model.
