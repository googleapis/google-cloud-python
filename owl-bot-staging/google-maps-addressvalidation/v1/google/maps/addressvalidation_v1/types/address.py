class Address(proto.Message):
    r"""Details of the post-processed address. Post-processing
    includes correcting misspelled parts of the address, replacing
    incorrect parts, and inferring missing parts.

    Attributes:
        formatted_address (str):
            The post-processed address, formatted as a
            single-line address following the address
            formatting rules of the region where the address
            is located.
        postal_address (google.type.postal_address_pb2.PostalAddress):
            The post-processed address represented as a
            postal address.
        address_components (MutableSequence[google.maps.addressvalidation_v1.types.AddressComponent]):
            Unordered list. The individual address
            components of the formatted and corrected
            address, along with validation information. This
            provides information on the validation status of
            the individual components.

            Address components are not ordered in a
            particular way. Do not make any assumptions on
            the ordering of the address components in the
            list.
        missing_component_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            The types of components that were expected to be present in
            a correctly formatted mailing address but were not found in
            the input AND could not be inferred. Components of this type
            are not present in ``formatted_address``,
            ``postal_address``, or ``address_components``. An example
            might be ``['street_number', 'route']`` for an input like
            "Boulder, Colorado, 80301, USA". The list of possible types
            can be found
            `here <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/requests-geocoding#Types>`__.
        unconfirmed_component_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            The types of the components that are present in the
            ``address_components`` but could not be confirmed to be
            correct. This field is provided for the sake of convenience:
            its contents are equivalent to iterating through the
            ``address_components`` to find the types of all the
            components where the
            [confirmation_level][google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.AddressComponent.confirmation_level]
            is not

            [inferred][google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.AddressComponent.inferred]
            flag is not set to ``true``. The list of possible types can
            be found
            `here <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/requests-geocoding#Types>`__.
        unresolved_tokens (MutableSequence[str]):
            Any tokens in the input that could not be resolved. This
            might be an input that was not recognized as a valid part of
            an address (for example in an input like "123235253253 Main
            St, San Francisco, CA, 94105", the unresolved tokens may
            look like ``["123235253253"]`` since that does not look like
            a valid street number.

            The name for this component.

            that the component is correct.

            Indicates that the component was not part of
            the input, but we inferred it for the address

            complete address.
        spell_corrected (bool):
            Indicates a correction to a misspelling in
            the component name.  The API does not always
            flag changes from one spelling variant to
            another, such as when changing "centre" to
            "center". It also does not always flag common

            replaced with a completely different one, for
            example a wrong postal code being replaced with
            one that is correct for the address. This is not
            a cosmetic change, the input component has been
            changed to a different one.
        unexpected (bool):
            Indicates an address component that is not
            expected to be present in a postal address for
            the given region. We have retained it only
            because it was part of the input.
