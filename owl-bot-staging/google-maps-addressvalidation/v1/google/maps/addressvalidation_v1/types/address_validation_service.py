    r"""The request for validating an address.

    Attributes:
        address (google.type.postal_address_pb2.PostalAddress):
            Required. The address being validated. Unformatted addresses
            should be submitted via
            [``address_lines``][google.type.PostalAddress.address_lines].

            The total length of the fields in this input must not exceed
            280 characters.

            Supported regions can be found
            `here <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/coverage>`__.

            The [language_code][google.type.PostalAddress.language_code]
            value in the input address is reserved for future uses and
            is ignored today. The validated address result will be
            populated based on the preferred language for the given
            address, as identified by the system.

            The Address Validation API ignores the values in
            [recipients][google.type.PostalAddress.recipients] and
            [organization][google.type.PostalAddress.organization]. Any
            values in those fields will be discarded and not returned.
            Please do not set them.
        previous_response_id (str):
            This field must be empty for the first address validation
            request. If more requests are necessary to fully validate a
            single address (for example if the changes the user makes
            after the initial validation need to be re-validated), then
            each followup request must populate this field with the
            [response_id][google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidateAddressResponse.response_id]
            from the very first response in the validation sequence.
        enable_usps_cass (bool):
            Enables USPS CASS compatible mode. This affects *only* the
            [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult.usps_data]
            field of
            [google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult]. Note:
            for USPS CASS enabled requests for addresses in Puerto Rico,
            a [google.type.PostalAddress.region_code] of the ``address``
            must be provided as "PR", or an
            [google.type.PostalAddress.administrative_area] of the
            ``address`` must be provided as "Puerto Rico"
            (case-insensitive) or "PR".

            It's recommended to use a componentized ``address``, or
            alternatively specify at least two
            [google.type.PostalAddress.address_lines] where the first
            line contains the street number and name and the second line
            contains the city, state, and zip code.
        session_token (str):
            Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session
            for billing purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64
            string with at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise
            an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

            The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and
            concludes when they select a place and a call to Place
            Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have
            multiple autocomplete queries, followed by one Place Details
            or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each
            request within a session must belong to the same Google
            Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the
            token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh
            token for each session. If the ``session_token`` parameter
            is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is
            charged as if no session token was provided (each request is
            billed separately).

            Note: Address Validation can only be used in sessions with
            the Autocomplete (New) API, not the old Autocomplete API.
            See
            https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/session-pricing
            for more details.

            The granularity of the **input** address. This is the result

            validation signals. For validation signals, refer to
            ``validation_granularity`` below.

            For example, if the input address includes a specific
            apartment number, then the ``input_granularity`` here will
            be ``SUB_PREMISE``. If we cannot match the apartment number
            in the databases or the apartment number is invalid, the
            ``validation_granularity`` will likely be ``PREMISE`` or
            below.

            The granularity level that the API can fully **validate**
            the address to. For example, an ``validation_granularity``
            of ``PREMISE`` indicates all address components at the level
            of ``PREMISE`` or more coarse can be validated.

            Per address component validation result can be found in

            Information about the granularity of the
            [``geocode``][google.maps.addressvalidation.v1.ValidationResult.geocode].
            This can be understood as the semantic meaning of how coarse
            or fine the geocoded location is.

            This can differ from the ``validation_granularity`` above
            occasionally. For example, our database might record the
            existence of an apartment number but do not have a precise
            location for the apartment within a big apartment complex.
            In that case, the ``validation_granularity`` will be

            ``PREMISE``.
