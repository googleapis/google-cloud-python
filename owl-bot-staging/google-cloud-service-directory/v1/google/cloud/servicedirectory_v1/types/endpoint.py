class Endpoint(proto.Message):
    r"""An individual endpoint that provides a
    [service][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1.Service]. The service
    must already exist to create an endpoint.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name for the endpoint in the format
            ``projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*/endpoints/*``.
        address (str):
            Optional. An IPv4 or IPv6 address. Service Directory rejects
            bad addresses like:

            -  ``8.8.8``
            -  ``8.8.8.8:53``
            -  ``test:bad:address``
            -  ``[::1]``
            -  ``[::1]:8080``

            Limited to 45 characters.
        port (int):
            Optional. Service Directory rejects values outside of
            ``[0, 65535]``.
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Annotations for the endpoint. This data can be
            consumed by service clients.

            Restrictions:

            -  The entire annotations dictionary may contain up to 512
               characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs.
               Annotations that go beyond this limit are rejected
            -  Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional
               prefix and name, separated by a slash (/). The name
               segment is required and must be 63 characters or less,
               beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
               ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.),
               and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If
               specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series
               of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253
               characters in total, followed by a slash (/) Annotations
               that fails to meet these requirements are rejected.

            Note: This field is equivalent to the ``metadata`` field in
            the v1beta1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to
            the same location in Service Directory.
        network (str):
            Immutable. The Google Compute Engine network (VPC) of the
            endpoint in the format
            ``projects/<project number>/locations/global/networks/*``.

            The project must be specified by project number (project id
            is rejected). Incorrectly formatted networks are rejected,
            we also check to make sure that you have the
            servicedirectory.networks.attach permission on the project
            specified.
        uid (str):
            Output only. The globally unique identifier
            of the endpoint in the UUID4 format.
