class Service(proto.Message):
    r"""An individual service. A service contains a name and optional
    metadata. A service must exist before
    [endpoints][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1.Endpoint] can be added
    to it.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name for the service in the format
            ``projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*``.
        annotations (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. Annotations for the service. This data can be
            consumed by service clients.

            Restrictions:

            -  The entire annotations dictionary may contain up to 2000
               characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs.
               Annotations that go beyond this limit are rejected
            -  Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional
               prefix and name, separated by a slash (/). The name
               segment is required and must be 63 characters or less,
               beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
               ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.),
               and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If
               specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series
               of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253
               characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Annotations
               that fails to meet these requirements are rejected

            Note: This field is equivalent to the ``metadata`` field in
            the v1beta1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to
            the same location in Service Directory.
        endpoints (MutableSequence[google.cloud.servicedirectory_v1.types.Endpoint]):
            Output only. Endpoints associated with this service.
            Returned on
            [LookupService.ResolveService][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1.LookupService.ResolveService].
            Control plane clients should use
            [RegistrationService.ListEndpoints][google.cloud.servicedirectory.v1.RegistrationService.ListEndpoints].
        uid (str):
            Output only. The globally unique identifier
            of the service in the UUID4 format.
