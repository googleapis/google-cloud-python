      PyCharm/JetBrains IDEs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      This library has now grown in size past the `JetBrains default size limit of ~2.5Mb`_.
      As a result, code completion in JetBrains products can fail to work with the classes from our library. To
      fix this, you need to update the ``idea.max.intellisense.filesize`` setting in custom properties
      (Help -> Edit custom properties...). Just add the line ``idea.max.intellisense.filesize = 10000`` to change this
      limit to ~10Mb.
