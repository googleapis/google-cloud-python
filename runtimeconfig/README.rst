Authentication
--------------

With ``google-cloud-python`` we try to make authentication as painless as
possible. Check out the `Authentication section`_ in our documentation to
learn more. You may also find the `authentication document`_ shared by all
the ``google-cloud-*`` libraries to be helpful.

Using the API
-------------

The Google Cloud `RuntimeConfig`_ (`RuntimeConfig API docs`_) API enables
developers to dynamically configure and expose variables through Google Cloud
Platform. In addition, you can also set Watchers and Waiters that will watch
for changes to your data and return based on certain conditions.
