"""Script to group changed packages into balanced shards for CI testing.

This script identifies which packages have changed compared to a target branch
(or since the last commit) and groups them into a fixed number of shards.
It uses package weights (configured via environment variables) to balance the
execution time across shards while maintaining alphabetical order and
contiguous grouping. All directory variants of a package (e.g. packages/foo and
preview-packages/foo) are kept aligned in the exact same shard.
