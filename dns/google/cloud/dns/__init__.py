"""Google Cloud DNS API wrapper.

The main concepts with this API are:

- :class:`~google.cloud.DNS.zone.ManagedZone` represents an collection of
  tables.
- :class:`~google.cloud.DNS.resource_record_set.ResourceRecordSet` represents
  a single resource definition within a zone.
- :class:`~google.cloud.DNS.changes.Changes` represents a set of changes
  (adding/deleting resource record sets) to a zone.
