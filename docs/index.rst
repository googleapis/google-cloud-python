Google Cloud Python API
=======================

.. warning::
  This library is **still under construction**
  and is **not** the official Google Python API client library.

Getting started
---------------

If you've never used ``gcloud`` before,
you should probably take a look at
:doc:`getting-started`.

Supported services
------------------

* **Cloud Datastore**
  (`official documentation <https://developers.google.com/datastore/>`_)

  - :doc:`datastore-quickstart`
  - :doc:`datastore-getting-started`
  - :doc:`datastore-api`

I found a bug!
--------------

Awesome!
The library is open source
and `lives on GitHub <https://github.com/jgeewax/gcloud>`_.
Open an issue,
or fork the library and submit a pull request.
